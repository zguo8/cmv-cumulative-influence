_____
It's my opinion that bench clearings in baseball hurts the sport.  When I go to a game I go to watch baseball, not a group of people crowd together like penguins and yell at each other.  Only the manager, replacement players and team coaches should be allowed on the field during game play.  A hefty fine would be given to any player entering the field of play when not authorized(i.e. a fielder must remain in the dugout until the ump call the third out complete. Unless that player is in the batters spot, on deck or a runner.)  Verbal altercations from the dugouts is impossible to enforce so they would be left to the umps discretion.

I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism, but in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups. For example, Congregationalists and Universaliists. 

So, my belief is that while religion can inform the views of people, it is far more likely that religion will be used to justify actions that would have been executed any way. I think that most Jewish people don't want to stone adulterers and most Muslims don't want to stone non believers.

2rpfn7,"CMV: Iran has the right to develop nuclear weapons",http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rpfn7/cmv_iran_has_the_right_to_develop_nuclear_weapons/,1.420717445E9,"First off, I do not believe that Iran *should* have nuclear weapons. In fact, I believe Iran having nuclear weapons makes the world less safe overall. However, I believe that as a sovereign nation they have the right to develop nuclear weapons if they so choose.

Why do I believe this:

1. It is in Iran's best strategic interests to develop nuclear weapons in order to counter Israel (which has nuclear weapons), and additionally to one-up Saudi Arabia (their main regional rival), and guarantee their safety against other Arab nations with whom they have historically had rocky relations (Iraq, for example).
2. If Israel can illegally possess nuclear weapons (they haven't officially acknowledge they have nuclear weapons, nor have they signed the UN's non-proliferation treaty, making the weapons they do possess illegal), why can't Iran possess nuclear weapons, other than Western bias? Pakistan has nuclear weapons, and they are officially an Islamic Republic, and they can have nuclear weapons, even though their nuclear weapons are probably much more of a global security risk. 

3. Iran has proven itself to be a pragmatic and rational actor in world affairs. There is no reason to suspect that they would actually use a nuclear weapon, nor sell it to a terrorist group who would. They mainly want a nuclear weapon to secure their military position in the region, stick it to their rivals, and as a point of national pride. Because the West says Iran can't have a nuclear weapon, they want one all the more, and won't back down on that because of national pride, something an American should be able to sympathize with. 

Now, I recognize that Iran should not have nuclear weapons because it would cause an arms race in the most volatile region on Earth, but that doesn't mean that they, as a sovereign nation, do not have the right to develop a nuclear weapon.

However, I would say that is not ok to bear animosity towards someone simply because they identify as a part of a certain religion. If they act in a harmful way because of their religion it is ok to hate them, but if they simply identify or agree with it but do not actually conduct any actions you believe to be wrong, than it is not ok to hold any grudge against them.

Like... six to twelve cans per day.  I rarely drink any regular soda with calories.  In fact, I grew up with diet soda and I tend to prefer the diet soda taste to regular soda.  Because of my amount of intake, I've spent a lot of time researching all of the facets of the issue, and I've found that the studies which condemn diet soda and/or aspartame are few and far between.  This is in direct contrast to all of the literature condemning diet soda and aspartame which is *not* scholarly.  In essence, the studies tend to say it's fine and the blogs tend to say it's not.  I put infinitely more faith in scientific rigor.  Aspartame is one of the most-studied compounds on the planet, and dozens (hundreds?) of nations have given it the okay.

There is likely a correlation between obesity and diet soda drinkers, however I think it's pretty obvious that causality is mixed up, here.  I think that 1) people who are obese are more likely to drink diet soda as a <&quot;>diet<&quot;>, and 2) people tend to order a diet soda along with a bunch of fast food or otherwise unhealthy food.  It's about the lifestyle which some live, not the diet soda itself.  I'm not interested in lifestyle, just the diet soda itself.

Some say that it ruins your teeth, but in the studies I've read they were testing people who already had poor oral hygiene.  I think that pretty much gives it away right there.  Additionally, I may only be a sample size of one, but I've had a lot of diet soda every day for years now, and I haven't had a cavity since before puberty.  Again, it's anecdotal, but it's something.

Please give me an argument, not just a link to a study.  I've read studies linked with regards to this topic before, and there is almost always some flaw, such as a diet soda drinker who already had poor oral hygiene, the drinker already being obese, or the behavior only being shown in rats.  **I'd like something that says that otherwise healthy people become unhealthy solely because of diet soda and/or aspartame, not the lifestyle which surrounds it.**

Thanks!

He took the position that they are unnatural. 

He cited this definition by Merriam-Webster:  existing in nature and not made or caused by people : coming from nature (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural) as his basis for the distinction for natural vs. unnatural.

However, I respectfully disagree with his position and furthermore that definition of natural. People arise from nature. Humankind's capacity to create, problem-solve, analyze, rationalize, and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural? It is only through natural occurrences that we have this ability, why is it that we would give the credit of these things solely to man, as opposed to nature? We are not separate from nature, thus, how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature, I would understand the distinction between natural and man-made. However, I think unnatural and man-made are not synonyms by any means. It seems to me that man-made things MUST be natural due to our being part of nature. 

I would love to hear your arguments and to have my view changed if I am mistaken in my logic somewhere along the line.

Please CMV.",http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rnrxj/cmv_im_extremely_scared_of_flying_please_cmv/,1.42068895E9,"I'm not sure this is a view that can be changed, since it is an irrational fear. However, I sure would like to change it, so let's see if it can be done.

I am aware that flying is perfectly safe on an intellectual level. Certainly safer than many, if not all, other forms of travel per mile. That said, a few things have made me petrified to fly.

1.) I used to be a pilot (small, 4-seater planes) and had a near-crash experience. I was practicing engine failures with an instructor. I had selected a field where I could land if this were a real emergency. We pulled the power out. About 100 feet above the ground, my instructor informed me that I had failed the exercise as we were too far down field, and that I would hit the trees ahead of us if this were a real emergency. My instructor told me that he we were going to put the power back in and try again. However, as he put the power back in, the engine just sputtered. My instructor took the controls from me. The engine continued to sputter. My instructor then informed me that he was going to position the wings to take the brunt of the hit. At that point, I thought that was it. This is how I die. Luckily, the engine did kick back in, and it seemed like we just avoided hitting the tops of those trees. Nevertheless, that experience shook me pretty hard, and I gave up piloting soon after.

2.) I had a good friend die on a commercial flight in 2009. After his death, I imagined over and over again how he must have spent the last few minutes of his life. At one point being okay, then all of a sudden the plane going into stomach-turning up and down undulation, before finally seeing the ground approaching way too fast. I imagine how his body must have shattered upon impact -- his internal organs not being able to keep up with the rapid deceleration of the rest of his body, shrapnel hitting and tearing up his body, then his skeleton shattering as it hit something hard before being swallowed up by a large fire all in a moment. I don't know if this is a scientifically accurate portrayal of his death, but this is how I imagine it anyway. It haunts me. What adds to my discomfort is the FDA report on the crash. They focused on the idle banter between the pilots right before the emergency. They focus on the fact that the pilots responded incorrectly to the emergency. Very little was said about the fact that the pilots were horrifically underrested, underpaid, and overworked. That seems to be a systemic problem that they refused to address, and it shakes my confidence in the governing body of aviation, and thus aviation as a whole.

3.) I've flown on commercial flights a few times since my friend's death. Every time, I am struck by horrifying anxiety attacks. I feel closed in, trapped. I feel like I have no control. I feel like I need to get out of my seat to have some air, do something, get out of this crowded space, anything I can to have some semblance of control. I become on edge. I feel like I can't breathe. It is a very frightening experience for me.

Because of these experiences I think my subconscious mind has overridden my rational mind. To me, flying is scary. Can anyone CMV on this?

I think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this. There would be even stronger calls for an anti-islam and anti-immigration policies. These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government. I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway). 

I think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying. Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries. I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the <&quot;>not one of us<&quot;> (pack) mentality and escalation of <&quot;>police state<&quot;>.
Change my view.

I feel almost ashamed as a lover of technology (long live the pc master race) to admit that I use my jailbroken ipod touch at least 20 times more than my phone. I know that it has shitty specs by comparison, the camera sucks and it isn't so good with multitasking but as someone who primarily uses handheld devices for video playback it couldn't be better. There are so many more tweaks that I have found to improve experience, despite iOS being objectively a much more closed system than Android and in my experience I have been able to make my jailbroken device look more beautiful and customized than I ever have with my phone (or have seen on other's Android phones).

I *want* to love Android because in my mind I know that it is just objectively better, but for media playback it just isn't a very  streamlined experience and I would have to describe it as clumsy.

2rnfn0,"CMV: Explaining causation is not <&quot;>blaming<&quot;> the victim, and it's a worthwhile endeavor.",http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rnfn0/cmv_explaining_causation_is_not_blaming_the/,1.420683443E9,"I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:
1) Explaining causation is not <&quot;>blaming<&quot;> the victim.
2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.

I'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 – I’m not certain that it’s a worthwhile endeavor.)

Let me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I’ve noticed – particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well – to blame the victims of terrible situations. We’re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn’t have been so drunk, or you shouldn’t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don’t deserve it. We like to think of our world as “just” in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people “Deserved” what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman “deserved” to be raped, but there’s a certain amount of “otherization” and lack of empathy that goes on – a sense that “well, that wouldn’t have happened to me, because I would’ve been more careful”. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that’s all bad.

On the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism – overt or structural – and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I’m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur – A and B – and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I’m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that’s not the view I’m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)

The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.

Thus, explaining causation is not justification. It’s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.

Finally, my second view is that it’s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we’ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they’re not, so we don’t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior – but it’s worth it to us, so that we don’t get mugged. 

I understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there’s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.

EDIT: Fixed a sentence.


EDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a <&quot;>worthwhile endeavor<&quot;> - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and <&quot;>explaining causation<&quot;> to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. 

As far as <&quot;>part 1<&quot;> of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term <&quot;>causation<&quot;> - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that <&quot;>avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged<&quot;>, or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that <&quot;>explaining causation is not victim blaming<&quot;>, and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think <&quot;>explaining causation<&quot;> is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. 

At any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.

Whether this attack was directly provoked by a printed image of Muhammad or not, my argument will be framed as if it were. I'll paraphrase some of my posts in other threads:

The problem I have with this is that non-Muslims came out of the blue to offend Muslims on this particular issue. There's no honor in that, we're not on any sort of moral high ground.

Consider this hypothetical: Previously, there was no issue with freedom of expression. Then Some Guy learns that many Muslims forbid printed images of their prophet. Guy says, <&quot;>hey, wouldn't it be *just hilarious* if we *printed an image of their prophet*??<&quot;> So Guy prints image of their prophet. Angry terrorist coward shoots and kills Guy. Guy's friends call him a martyr, cry censorship. Except there is no censorship, freedom of expression still exists 100%, Guy's publication and others can and likely will post more of these images in the future. 

If a group of people is encroaching upon your rights or beliefs then by all means defend yourself as appropriate. And as I understand it, many Muslim factions are indeed doing that around Europe and there is no insignificant amount of tension. But in this particular instance, *we kindof started it.* We created an issue where there was none.

Freedom of expression does not imply freedom from consequences. SHOULD murder be the consequence? *Absolutely not.* However, what *should be* in this world and *what are* are two completely different things; so, we fight battles to turn the <&quot;>what ares<&quot;> into the <&quot;>should bes.<&quot;> Is the battle to print images of Muhammad, among human trafficking and rape and all the other issues, really one we need to be fighting, really worth losing lives over? I guess for some, maybe. I wonder how that policeman and his family feel about it. 

So now, we created a situation where 1) we defend freedom of speech at high cost and continue to print things like this, or 2) we censor ourselves and the turrists win. It's a situation born of childishness that has now ended in tragedy and left us with a difficult path forward. The <&quot;>point<&quot;> that now exists to be made did not exist before our initial and unprovoked challenge to Muslim beliefs. And in the name of what, *satire*?

What value does philosophy have in the modern age, right now, aside from contemplating things. Is it truly worth it to invest a significant amount of time and money studying this field? 

There do not seem to be any tangible applications or appreciable benefits from studying philosophy aside from personal growth and the expansion of one's intellectual perspective, which I argue can be gained without studying philosophy in a rigorously academic manner.  

I often have read the argument that it is impossible to argue that philosophy is useless without using philosophy, or something along those lines.

I acknowledge this. Yes, I am engaging in the use of philosophy right now, at this very moment. However, this does not provide an argument as to why it would be worthwhile to STUDY philosophy. 

What do you gain from studying philosophy that could not be gained from thoughtful introspection? 

Certainly, important tools have originated from philosophical study, such as the scientific method, and science could be described as a subset of philosophy itself but that isn't an argument against the lack of tangible benefits to be gained from studying philosophy.

You don't need to study philosophy to become a capable scientist. You shouldn't need to study philosophy to cultivate a reasonable set of moral principles, or to be thoughtful about the circumstances and situations you encounter in your life.

Intelligence is at least partially genetic and therefore passed down by parents, yes? [Yes.](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40459/title/Inherited-Intelligence/)

So, what if, instead of killing off the less-intelligent people (I'm against killing. Of most things.) we just limit offspring?

For example, we could use the IQ scale (for want of a better intelligence measure) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to.
Like, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that's the number of offspring you're allowed to create.

So someone with near average intelligence (near 100 IQ, 75-124) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring. 
The total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it. A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children (not each.) and sustain their population.

Conversely, really above average IQs of 125-174 can contribute genetically towards 3 children... and so on.

This would eventually make the human race smarter, and therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race. 

I know this would be a bitch to implement and it's near impossible to actually do, but I'm just looking at the concept. I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused... I know all that.

Exceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit, or etc. (If a mother can make 2, and has twins, she can't make more, but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes 3, we're not gonna kill one)

Perhaps if you have a major, heritable health issue your IQ has 25 subtracted from it before being rounded? Or maybe weighted differently, like extremely high chance of cancer (almost 100 percent or something) takes off more... Something like that.

Much better than <&quot;>Kill off those with IQ less than 80<&quot;>

I wouldn't mind a smarter human race...

EDIT: **I am trying to argue that this process, if not abused, if followed by the people, and if we found an increasingly accurate measure of intelligence, would be ultimately a good thing to advance the human race.**

The type of man that reads a book that argues against a position he already holds, in the hopes that he can understand the entire issue in a great light.

But far and away, this is not the case. Some of the posts on here include logical fallacies even in the titles: yesterday's [atheism post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rfea1/) used a strawman fallacy in the title to misrepresent their own position to make it easier to defend in a religion vs. athiesm debate. The OP, if you read that post, was by and large not interested in changing his opinion, and this is true of the *vast majority* of posts that come through here.

And the problem is this: it is a tremendous waste of time for every knowledgable person that posts answers in here. A lot of times, the posts are not controversial: they are simply the product of stupidity. There are a thousand places, a million internet hits, which one can browse to discover facts on the athiesm/religion debate and even the specific subtopic that was discussed yesterday. An educated person, or rather, a person seeking to educate himself, would have simply utilized this vast body of resources rather than take time to create a new resource.

Additionally, the people that tend to post in this subreddit post on this subreddit have a certain mindset already, even before submitting. Go ahead, think of something you believe that is controversial and click <&quot;>Submit CMV.<&quot;> Your mind will already be working to inhibit opposing opinions and you will be clinging harder than ever to the bulwarks of your argument. The fact of the matter is this: it takes considerable effort to open one's mind, even on things that are not of great consequence. And most people are simply unable to accomplish this.

Thanks for your replies. I intend to reply to each response to my original post, albeit maybe not today, and I hope to award many deltas for your efforts.

Quick edit: I realized I didn't address the second part of my title claim. Albert Einstein said that 2 things are limitless: the universe and human stupidity. For every stupid person that posts on this sub to address one point of their lack of knowledge, there are foreseeably dozens more points of misunderstanding that remain. What is the overall aim of this subreddit? To educate one at a time, indeed. But on issues that can be solved via Google search or the opening of a book, how can one fill the infinite pit of human stupidity? Only controversial issues, where both opinions are agreed to be at least understandable and held widely by educated people, should be allowed. This is a real debate: anything else is just convincing a stupid person of something that they fail to understand.

2rkf8n,"CMV: Prerequisites for courses should be replaced by a <&quot;>(strongly) suggested background<&quot;>",http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rkf8n/cmv_prerequisites_for_courses_should_be_replaced/,1.420615086E9,"Having gone through schooling for countless years in a variety of disciplines, prerequisites have been more of a hurdle than help. I realize my view is possibly more of an ideal, but places truly looking to educate their students should acknowledge the true reason for prerequisites and search for better alternatives. 

I am mainly going to look at prerequisites being enforced at publicly-funded Universities and high-schools, and will share a few real examples I've encountered with friends over the years here:

Case 1: Friend in high school cannot apply to an Architecture program because she lacks Grade 12 Physics (and Grade 11 Physics, which is the prerequisite). It is first semester of twelfth grade for her, but she has two other necessary Math courses conflicting in time with the only 2 offerings of Grade 11 Physics courses at her school. She will now have to take Grade 11 Physics elsewhere on top of her normal schooling (but must still remain a full-time student to apply to the Universities). This will cost her both time and money unnecessarily when she can herself try to learn the material for Grade 11 Physics independently, and if asked, write an exam to take Grade 12 Physics in the second semester, which will actually give her a chance to join the Architecture program (assuming only Grade 12 marks are looked at for admission). Unfortunately, she cannot do this by school guidelines, and now has to take an accelerated Grade 11 and 12 course privately on top of her normal school schedule. 

Case 2: Friend wants to take a Cell Biology and Biochemistry course out of pure interest and also because he can use it to complete his degree. He's taken 1st-year Biology, but not 1st-year Chemistry, and can thus not enrol in Biochemistry. Biochemistry is also a prerequisite for Cell Biology, and by not taking 1st-year Chemistry, he cannot enrol in either course. I have taken 1st-year Chemistry, and can attest to how little it was used in these courses. All of the concepts could easily be understood and students could have done well with minimal Chemistry knowledge (and some did). They are both 2nd-year Biochemistry and Cell Biology courses, and all of the Chemistry handled was incredibly basic (high school Chemistry would be more than sufficient) or was already taught in the 1st-year Biology course. In this case, he simply had not the time nor money to enrol in 1st-year Chemistry, and was thus restricted from enrolling in Biochemistry or Cell Biology. Even after requesting special permission and trying to prove his background and asking the profs for the necessary Chemistry background, he was denied. 

Case 3: A 3rd-year Quantum Mechanics course requires a 2nd-year DE course. I will say that DE is an integral part of the course and for a student lacking this knowledge, they will fall behind and do poorly. I also have a friend whom could not take the 2nd-year DE course with me because he would have to overload and it would be quite costly. Nonetheless, he learned the DE content on his own time when he could over the summer break and weekends. Heck, he probably went over more concepts in DE than we did in our 1 semester class. But, because he did not take this specific course, he cannot take the 3rd-year Quantum Mechanics course, thus pushing him back with his coursework. He will be taking the DE course, but only in the future and only because it is a part of the degree requirements. If a student wants to learn something earlier and they are confident in their background, why stop them? 

Now special permission can sometimes be obtained for enrolment from the course coordinator, but more often that not (from my experience) this is not the case and only happens in extreme circumstances. In the above cases, my friends all asked for special permission and were denied without even a chance to prove they have a sufficient background to keep up with the class (and possibly excel).  

Students should be in charge of their own education. If institutions want to (strongly) suggest a few other courses or materials ahead of time or possibly require a passing grade on a entrance test, sure, let them do that to ensure the class goes at an appropriate level. 

I also just want to clarify that I believe anti-requisites are very important for courses.

EDIT: A student taking the course should not interfere with the University's right to confer them a degree if they've not completed the appropriate prerequisites for the degree itself. If two courses are necessary for the degree, the student must complete them. No privilege is given for taking the course itself. I am talking about why they cannot simply enrol in the course. That's it. My views are idealistic, but there certainly can be improvements at very little expense.

I am almost continually tense while on the road thinking about what's at stake (and I've been driving for almost 20 years).

While I have never been in an accident, I often find myself thinking how dangerous even small motions of a driver can be. For example, a sudden small jerking movement of an arm on the steering wheel leading the car into oncoming traffic can lead to almost certain instant death. I cannot think of any other action in my daily life where so many small actions (of me or other people) can be lethal.

Even leaving accidents and catastrophic scenarios out of consideration, driving a car seems extremely risky to me: For many, maybe most people their car is the most expensive single item that they own. Even small mistakes like a lack of concentration or a tiny miscalculation while parking into a small space, can lead to high damage and expensive repairs.

It's my understanding that empathy is largely an immutable personality trait that has little to no component of personal choice involved.

Trying to shame someone for not being empathetic is no different than trying to shame someone for any other innate trait of who they are, be it sexuality, race, or physical size.

I personally see the act as even worse when it comes up during conversations regarding social issues because it's most likely to be said by someone who would condemn insulting someone based on some part of themselves they can't control.

From a perspective of social power, I will go ahead and point out that shaming those who lack empathy is an institutionalized process that comes from the idea of empathy being fundamentally good, as opposed to it just being one aspect of the human personality.

So... CMV.

(v) a new understanding of physics comparable to free infinite clean energy. Any day now, I am sure.

2rieng,"CMV: We the people of all countries should ALWAYS be allowed to record police officers and public officials (In Germany we are NOT!!)",http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rieng/cmv_we_the_people_of_all_countries_should_always/,1.420578776E9,"Hello reddit,

I'm from Germany and given that I've travelled through the United States for a couple of months and talked to a lot of (<&quot;>free minded<&quot;>) people, my views about the importance of freedom have changed dramatically.

What I've come to realize is that we the people are the one who make the law.
(Theoretically) we delegate our authority to public officials and police men to have them enforce the laws **we** voted on to have in our society.
&amp;nbsp;

Because we delegate a certain amount of authority to these people they are in a position in which they *could* abuse the power we give them.

Thus we need to be able to check on them and, in case of doubt, proof what really happened.

Though here in Germany we are **not** allowed to film policemen! They have the same kind of personal rights as every other citizen.
So we basically give them *more* authority and rights (I can't just demand other citizens to show me their ID) but *equal* accountability and personal rights.

It's true that police violence is very rare here in Germany, but given our history I think it's absolutely **crucial** that we as the people have the opportunity to hold every authority accountable and challenge it (if necessary) so that something like the Third Reich cannot happen again.

Though, most people I talk to don't see the reason why public officials should have less personal rights (e.g. be filmed without permission while on duty) than regular citizens, given the very rare cases of police-violence and power abuse and because <&quot;>they're people like you and I<&quot;>.

&amp;nbsp;
--
tl;dr: **CMV**: Public officials should **not** have an equal right to privacy and be able to decide whether or not they want to be filmed/recorded. They were elected by the people and we should be able to hold them accountable for their actions while on duty. Been given more rights means also given more responsibility and giving up a certain amount of privacy in order to serve the people as intended by the law they are enforcing.

&amp;nbsp;
Thanks for any controversy! :)  



**EDIT 1: LEGAL SITUATION**  
I was doing some further research on the legal situation and it seems to be a bit more complicated then I originally thought:

- You ARE allowed to film policemen.
- You are NOT allowed to publish videos/photos of policemen without their consent.
- Police CAN seize something to avert a contemporary danger.
- DEFINITION: A danger is contemporary if the impact of the harmful event has already begun or if the impact  is coming up immediately or in the next future with a probability to happen near to certainty.
- The policemen has to decide whether or not there is an according situation of danger.

That means: If a policemen sees the danger of you breaking the law (§ 33 KunstUrhG = copyright and privacy law) - e.g. by you publishing videomaterial against their will - he/she can seize your camera to avert the danger of you breaking the law.

In one precedence (Beschluss v. 30.10.2000 - 5 A 291/00 - Verlags-Archiv Nr. 779) a judge decided that <&quot;>the sheer recording of a police operation does not found a contemporary danger of violating §§ 22, 23, 33 KunstUrhG [right in one's own image]. If there is specific indication of illegal publishing, seizing the photo-, videomaterial may be justified.<&quot;>

(Original: <&quot;>Das Filmen oder Fotografieren eines polizeilichen Einsatzes begründet allein noch nicht die gegenwärtige Gefahr, die Aufnahmen würden unter Verstoß gegen §§ 22, 23, 33 KunstUrhG (Recht am eigenen Bild) verbreitet. Deuten konkrete Anhaltspunkte auf eine rechtswidrige Verbreitung der Aufnahmen hin, kann die Sicherstellung von Foto- und Filmmaterial gerechtfertigt sein.<&quot;>)

It does not define what qualifies as specific indication of you publishing the material. A slightly annoyed demeanor *might* be enough. (my interpretation)

It's also important to know that the German definition of <&quot;>publication<&quot;> supposedly *includes* publication in private (e.g. family members). (I couldn't find the original law, though. It might be in § 17 Verbreitungsrecht or in a definition of the word <&quot;>Öffentlichkeit<&quot;> [public])

No matter how much you are tortured, at some point you die. Even decades of suffering eventually end with death from old age. In the afterlife, suffering could be eternal.

Or imagine being a ghost, a consciousness without a body. Watching the world, but never being able to interact with it. For eternity. No sleep, no rest, no way out.

2rhve5,"CMV: Minimum Wages Should Automatically Adjust Based on a Price Index",http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rhve5/cmv_minimum_wages_should_automatically_adjust/,1.420560657E9,"Note: While this general argument may apply to other countries points made below will be specific to the point of view of the United States.

Recently it's been in the news that many states have increased minimum wages this year without action from the federal government. In case one is not familiar currently the minimum wage is passed into passed as an hourly figure into law. To update the figure it requires another law to amend the older one. The Federal Government sets a minimum wage which is a universal minimum for all businesses operating within the United States. Individual states may opt to raise the minimum wage above that level if they wish.

Hard coding the minimum wage into law in this way is inefficient and usually damaging to most parties involved. Political parties and politicians suffer because it distracts them from working on other issues which may be more important, forcing them to make what should be trivial adjustments and sets up a perpetually recurring fight. Depending on which party has control of the house, senate, and white house it may be impossible to get any legislation through congress or the state level of government for years at a time. To get the minimum wage raised requires a large amount of political capital because it is such a controversial issue. Raising the minimum wage is a zero sum game with one of the two parties benefiting from action or lack of it. Due to this it is a toxic subject to breech in congress.

Workers suffer from the fighting in congress because for long periods of time they experience either low or no wage increases meaning that for many years their income does not keep track with the rate of inflation. Because of this they may not be able to buy the things they need with their paycheck thus defeating the point of minimum wage.

Businesses suffer because they have uncertainty over their labor costs from the fighting. While they may get savings due to declining wages relative to purchasing power in the long term they have to worry about not only the demands of the labor market but also the uncertainty of who will win a given election and what the political priorities of the newly elected majority will be. This creates uncertainty and may cause employers to delay hiring decisions and postpone growth.

In short there aren't many people who truly win with the way we currently adjust minimum wage. One of the key problems with the current system is we don't give bureaucrats the authority to do their job. It is the ultimate in micromanagement literally requiring an act of congress to do anything. This is a systemic issue in almost all areas of the federal government but it's especially acute here. At it's core congress should only focus on the big picture. It should be Congress' job to decide if there should be a minimum wage or not and set guidelines for what level it should be set at and the job of the executive branch to decide how much the exact numbers should be.

**The Cost of Labor**

Minimum wage is a CMV in and of itself and has been discussed in many other threads on this sub in the past. **I don't want people to argue about whether or not there should be a minimum wage in this thread or the specific figure that the minimum wage should be.** The assumptions and limitations here are to limit what would invariably be off topic debates, I want to discuss this specific issue and not a broader one. Let's just go with the assumption that the existence of a minimum wage is a given and getting rid of it is not an option.

The greatest benefit to a minimum wage is that if someone is able to get a job and get enough hours to work full time they will have enough money that to support themselves without having to rely on public assistance. At the risk of being overly simplistic the key idea is that there is a given minimum amount of money that a person must spend every month to stay alive. There is a higher amount of money that a person must spend to have what society would consider an acceptable standard of living. If someone does not have the money to pay these costs then they will either eventually die and/or live in substandard conditions unless an outside force intervenes. Let's also assume that a person has no way of getting resources other than buying them at fair market value and can't grow, steal, beg, or barter for them.

If the we as a society decide that we should not let people die for lack of money, then the only way for them to get the resources they need is for everyone else who has money to pay a portion of their earnings in taxes. The taxes are then used to purchase these resources for the individuals that don't have the ability to buy them for themselves.

If you allow businesses to pay people less than what it costs for one person to afford these resources then you are shifting the cost of supporting that person from the owners of the business to everybody in society. This is unfair because the business is the one that is benefiting from the labor of this individual yet they are not paying market value for it. As such it should be able to establish that the amount of money necessary for self-sufficiency is the basic cost of human capital.

This makes more sense when you think of labor in the same way you would think of other commodities. If you were to take a crop such as coffee and allow farmers to lease or buy land at below market value then the price of coffee wouldn't be accurate. I don't think most people would think it would be fair to expect other people to pay for the farmer's land.

**The Proposed Solution**

We have hopefully established that there is a basic cost for human capital. To calculate what the cost is for human labor all one would need to do is add up the costs necessary to buy the basic resources every year and then divide by the number of given working hours in a year. As above I would like to request that people not argue about the exact definitions of what should be included in the definition of necessary resources and how many hours is fair to work in a week, those are all debates for other CMVs.

This should theoretically be very easy but we here we run into another problem with the minimum wage. Not all areas have equal costs of living and thus the cost of necessary resources is dependant entirely on where you are located and what the lowest cost for those goods in that area is. This changes on not only a city by city basis but also on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis within a city. You could have millions of different answers for minimum wages dependant on many different factors.

To simplify this we could group similar areas into different regions and run this calculation for each. This approach would make more sense for businesses because they could make more efficient decisions about where they should hire labor from based on the cost of living. For higher paying jobs they already do this, but this could see an explosion of jobs in low cost areas due to the low minimum wage. One of the core principles of economics is that incentives matter. If costs aren't accurate then the decisions that companies make will be biased and it will result in a more inefficient allocation of resources.

The next thing you would need to address is how do you get the data on the cost of living. For the most part we are already collecting this data for the consumer price index. The CPI would not be useful for this however because it includes data on all things in the economy, not just the basic resources needed to maintain life. To get this right you would need to create a new price index specifically for the minimum wage.

Additionally prices constantly change, that is the reason for automatic updates to the minimum wage to begin with. If you had the data you could update the minimum wage as frequently as desired. Practically speaking however, changing the minimum wage frequently would create a compliance nightmare for businesses and regulators. To reduce this burden making it so the minimum only adjusts on longer timescales is more beneficial. The best approach here is likely to update the minimum wage on an annual basis.

To offset variations in market prices and within regions as well as the risk of having incomplete or faulty data it would only make sense that the minimum wage has some sort of padding on top of it as a margin of error. As an initial estimate I would assume this margin of error would somewhere between 1.5% and 7%, because the rates of inflation are usually between 2%-3% within a given calendar year. However the exact number of course could be adjusted based on data and you would need to determine how variable prices and the commonality of errors to find the optimum value. Developing a formula would allow you to make minimum wages dynamically adjust based on the previous year's volatility or specific conditions in a certain region. When calculating margins of error it would likely be better to err on the side of a higher wage than a lower one.

(**tl;dr**) What you'd end up with is:

Minimum Hourly Wage = ( Regional Minimum Wage Price Index for Year / Full Time Working Hours per Year ) * ( 1 + Padding Margin Percentage )

**Previous attempts at this idea**

In the 1970s during the period of double digit inflation rates this idea was floated by the Democrat party and made significant headway but received substantial opposition because of the high interest rates and the fear that these would remain for a long period of time.

Edit: /u/srak has pointed out that this has existed in Belgium since 1919.

Feel free to point out any problems you see in the idea of the minimum cost of human capital since this is essential to the promise that the wages should automatically adjust. Without that assumption everything else doesn't make any sense.

2rh4rz,"CMV: Romeo and Juliet is not a satire of the irrationality of young people",http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rh4rz/cmv_romeo_and_juliet_is_not_a_satire_of_the/,1.420543744E9,"One of the most common interpertations of Romeo and Juliet is that it's a satire of how young people act. I do not believe Romeo and Juliet is a primarily a satire of rash decisions made by youth,  as many people think.  While,  some of it is a condemnation of how sometimes “young men's love then lies, / Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes” that isn't the main theme of the story.  Rather,  the main theme of the story is about the importance of forgiveness.  My argument relies heavily on another Shakespeare play,  the Tempest.  

In the Tempest,  two major characters are Ferdinand, and Miranda.  They're essentially the Romeo and Juliet of their play.  Although the rivalry between their families is one-sided,  Miranda's father, Propsero, hate's Ferdinand's father because Ferdinand's father had wronged Prospero in the past.  In the Tempest,  two teens also meet and fall in love very quickly.    Ferdinand and Miranda meet each other,  fall in love,  and decide to get married all in the span of an afternoon,  however,  they have a happy ending,  while Romeo and Juliet die.  

It has been a full year since I was in an English class,  but I remember in my class,  my professor said that most of Shakespeare’s plays follow what's called <&quot;>the rule of time<&quot;>.  The rule of time states that all the events in the play should happen in a relatively short timespan.  From what I can remember, most of Shakespeare’s plays follow this,  with Merchant of Venice being one of the few exceptions.   For this reason,  I don't believe the amount of time that passed in the play is evidence that R&amp;J is satire. 

If we're going to look at the relationships of the characters through the eyes of a cynic the relationship between Ferdinand and Miranda is even more rash and impulsive than the relationship between Romeo and Juliet.  Early on in the play,  it's revealed that Ferdinand and Prospero are the only human men Miranda has ever seen in her life, “This, / Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first /  That e'er I sigh'd for”.  Also,  immediately after they meet,  before they've even kissed,  Ferdinand agrees to become a slave to win Prospero's favour.  If Shakespeare did want to  mock irrational decisions made by teens,  then the Tempest would have been a better opportunity than Romeo and Juliet.

So,  why did Romeo and Juliet’s relationship fail and why did Ferdinand and Miranda's relationship prosper?  Romeo and Juleit's families were unable to forgive each other until after the two teens died.  The families of Ferdinand and Miranda were able to reconcile before anyone died.  Prospero is actually put in the position to kill Ferdinand's father after taking him prisoner.   Rather than murdering Ferdinand's father,  Prospero chooses to forgive him even though he still hates what Ferdinand's father did to him.

“Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th' quick,

Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury

Do I take part. **The rarer action is**

**In virtue than in vengeance**. They being penitent,

The sole drift of my purpose doth extend

Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel.

My charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll restore,

And they shall be themselves.“

Because the cycle of vengence is broke in the Tempest,  Miranda and Ferdinand get a happy ending. 

The Capulets and the Montagues are not able to reconcile until the deaths of Romeo and Juliet have occurred.   During the masquerade Tybalt realizes that Romeo has attended the party,  even though members of house Montague are banned from attending.  Tybalt wishes to kill Romeo for this,  but Lord Capulet stops him as Romeo isn't a bad guy,   “And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
 / To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:”.  Tybalt however,  instead of forgiving Romeo for attending a party without an invitation,  decides to let his hatred for Romeo fester,  treating Romeo's actions as a personal insult. “I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall / Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.”.  Tybalt and Romeo would later have an altercation after Romeo and Juliet get married.  Tyblat is unaware of this marriage and still hates Romeo,  while Romeo refuses to fight “
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love: / And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender / As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.”.  This inability to forgive each other is what leads to the deaths of numerous characteres.  

The ending to Romeo and Juliet is very bitter-sweet,  the two teens are dead,  but it was their death that had caused the vendetta to stop.  The deaths of Romeo and Juliet causes  the Capulets and Montagues finally reconcile,  after seeing what their hatred did to their families, and the family of the Prince. “Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!/ See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate, / That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love. / And I for winking at your discords too / Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd”.   The deaths that occurred in the play were a result of the inability to forgive,  and the ending of the play is the characters realizing that.

Right now, the 1% pay the lion share of taxes, and therefore the Walmart workers living expenses are spread out among all tax payers, and paid mostly by the rich.

If they get off food stamps, because they are making more per hour, you better believe Walmart (whether they have to or not, they will) will raise prices.

So now that prices have gone up, you the tax payer are still subsidizing their living expenses, except:

- The 1% are no longer contributing at all because they don't shop at Walmart.
- The poor people you're trying to help, who can't afford to shop anywhere BUT Walmart are now paying higher prices for goods. 

These people previously did not subsidize the employees earnings because their earnings were too low to be taxed (those on fixed incomes, disability, retirement, and other minimum wage workers), but now they pay more money, and are <&quot;>taxed<&quot;> on something they weren't before.

Additionally,  a worker losing 200 a month in food stamps in exchange for a dollar an hour raise seems to cancel out their raise... leading to higher prices for all with no real benefit

2rgszm,"CMV: Police officers should have stricter guidelines on when they can use their firearms or in some cases be disarmed completely of the ability to use lethal force.",http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rgszm/cmv_police_officers_should_have_stricter/,1.420537736E9,"The stated mission of police is to <&quot;>serve and protect<&quot;> the people, and obviously from what we've seen recently in the news this mission is being strayed from.

I am against the idea that police should be especially respected and revered as it contributes to their own idea that their lives matter more than those of the citizenry. What this has led to is a police culture of being able to take a human life at the first sign that an officer's life is in danger, even remotely. 

If a person is actually committed to being a benevolent protector of the public, he or she should be willing to take a greater personal risk in being that protector. It is my view that many officers should be disarmed of the ability to use lethal force - guns should only be carried under circumstances in which there is an actual chance of having to draw them in a fight for one's life i.e. police are going after a known dangerous individual. 

This would undoubtedly lead to an increase in officers not being able to brandish a lethal weapon in situations where they previously would have. Some police officers would die where they wouldn't have before. But many fewer unnecessary civilian deaths would occur. In my opinion, cops being lethally armed and authorized to take lethal action whenever they feel threatened is not worth the cost we have been witnessing where many avoidable civilian deaths occur.

I think it is somewhat tragic that carrying a gun is what in many ways defines what an American police officer is - someone with the ability to kill at any time should they feel it is necessary. In an ideal world where our culture did not dictate that police carry guns I think it would be great if every morning individual officers made a reasonable choice as to whether or not they would need a gun that day for whatever reason. Unfortunately this culture could not exist in America today.

Obviously in place of guns I would have increased use of tazers, not just the short-range handheld kind but also the adapted shotgun models that reach a range similar to that of a gun. Rubber bullets would also be acceptable. 

My main point is that cops should be taking a greater personal risk in serving the public as our current system of valuing police life above the citizenry is what has led to such endemic unnecessary police violence.

CMV. Assuming there is no afterlife, life is ultimately meaningless and pointless because we die. Death is the great eraser. Living life is as irrational as reading a book that, after finished, is immediately erased from your memory. It is comparable to that, too. 

It makes no difference if I, a 23 year old, die now or live until I am 100 and die. Either way, after my brief spark of existence I become nothingness. Not only do I remember nothing; I AM nothing. To me, it is as if my life had never happened. 

I'll put it another way. Imagine the time before you were born. Have you remembered it yet? Of course not. You didn't exist. This is the state that we return to after death--a state of nothingness similar to the state we were in before birth. When I die, I return to this state after a brief period of consciousness, and I return to it permanently. I might as well have never lived. 

To anticipate a few responses:

(1) Helping others doesn't matter. They will die too. And then their descendants will die, on and on and on, until eventually the universe is destroyed or our galaxy collapses in an inevitable heat-death. Even if 1,000,000 people were helped by me, assuming they all die, then my life is still pointless and meaningless. For I will be dead and won't know what I did, and once they die, they won't know either. 

(2) Attaining fame doesn't matter and doesn't truly make me <&quot;>immortal.<&quot;> I'll be dead, and again, death is nothingness. Thus, I won't be around to enjoy my fame. 

(3) Enjoying the moment is possible, but doesn't make life have a point. For once I die, all memories and all point is gone.

I know there's an argument that consumer data drives new product, but even Steve Jobs once said that you can't ask a customer what they want because by the time you make it, they'll want something else. It's difficult to figure out what a customer wants based upon consumer data. It's much better to have focus groups and look at interest trends than to collect data, when you consider all of the other major problems with having that information in the cloud.

- **Determinism** : All events are certain, the entire outcome of an event is based on existing conditions, or **predetermined**. (Ex. *Event A will cause Event B.*)

- **Indeterminism** : No event is certain, and the entire outcome of an event is based on probability, or **chance**. (Ex. *Event A might cause Event B or Event C.*)

**BACKGROUND** 

After the 18th century, most scientists agreed that the universe was deterministic, that it was governed by strict scientific laws that could be discovered and applied to determine the outcome of any event. Thus, determinism seems to challenge the possibility of free will. If one accepts determinism, then the universe, and any person in it, is governed by strict scientific laws. This means that any event, including an individual's choices could be determined based on scientific knowledge and causality, or cause-and-effect. However, advancements in quantum mechanics challenged determinism, ultimately proposing a universe that follows general scientific laws but one which does not have a predetermined future.

It was Werner Heisenberg who discovered indeterminism within the measurement of basic variables. Heisenberg's experiments and analysis showed that uncertainties always occurred when attempting to measure the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time. Heisenberg concluded that these uncertainties or imprecisions in the measurements were fundamental in the universe and are inherent mathematical properties in quantum mechanics. Voila! Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the basis for quantum tunneling and how nuclear fusion occurs in stars.

**MY VIEW / PERSONAL**

I am a twenty-five year old nuclear engineer, and as you probably guessed it, I work at a nuclear power plant. I spend a lot of time thinking about philosophy, from a scientific standpoint. This past weekend, I had the wonderful privilege of going on a series of dates with a rather remarkably intelligent, and beautiful, young woman. To my surprise, after a few drinks, we were discussing very riveting topics, one of which based around **<&quot;>Free Will<&quot;>**. We both agreed that chemistry and physics define the universe around us, and since humans are made of matter, we are also governed by those scientific laws as well. If this is truly the case, humans exist in a deterministic universe where everything can be predicted, even our decisions... given enough scientific knowledge. Conclusion: <&quot;>Free-Will<&quot;> is an illusion.

Now, fast-forward to two days later. I'm still thinking about the discussion and bending my mind around any way to disprove my theory scientifically. (I personally love to play Devil's Advocate to my own theories.) I haven't been able to, and actually, I've further convinced myself of it. I started digging around in a lot of my quantum physics books, and in combination with reading a good deal of philosophy, I have come to the following conclusions:

- 1) Our universe is indeterminate. When considering the wave-particle duality of matter, I am fairly convinced that the universe is not determinate, or at least <&quot;>nearly<&quot;> indeterminate if specific events are not possible in this universe.

- 2) What do I mean by <&quot;>nearly<&quot;> indeterminate? Perhaps, specific events appear determinate due to a system in which certain events cannot occur, thus forcing a determinate solution from an indeterminate system.

If I believe that the universe is indeterminate, everything is a matter of chance. In short, *Event A probabilistically causes Event B or Event C.* However, the presence of Event C doesn't imply Event A happened. Also, the presence of Event A doesn't imply Event B or Event C will happen. Infact, there is the potential that nothing could happen if the sum of the probabilities of Events B and C doesn't equal 1.

So what does this all mean? 

**I believe that our universe is governed by indeterminism. This means that the future is not necessarily constrained to a single course. However, I believe that the probability of certain events occurring is zero, and thus appears to be deterministic. For example, if I throw my phone directly over my head, gravity will cause it to fall directly on my head. There is no other outcome, as the probability of gravity acting as the driving force is absolute. The event is trivial. I believe the same is true for chemical reactions, that they will behave in what appears to be a deterministic manner to do an <&quot;>absolute<&quot;> outcome. Thus, I would state that while our universe is indeterminate, we still do lack <&quot;>Free-Will<&quot;>. Or, perhaps our understanding of energy and matter is wrong, and what appears indeterminate within our current understanding is determinate in a different scientific field.**

Please, provide any opinions or insight you have. I've been thinking on this topic non-stop and want to know what Reddit thinks. I understand that this topic has been discussed here, but more importantly, I am aiming to address the following in regard to my view, **<&quot;>Is it possible that we live in an indeterminate universe where events are left to chance, but we, as humans still lack Free-Will?<&quot;>**

I'll give you an example:


Let's say a person is completly isolated from religion, - it still exists, but he doesn't know that, nobody ever says anything about religion while near him, and he simply cannot see churches and other religious structures (suck it, this is just a made up story, you got my point).
The word <&quot;>religion<&quot;> is unknown to him and he doesn't know a single bit about religion.

This person goes through education just like any normal kid, but he is not taught of religion.
When he finishes college, somebody shows him this whole concept of <&quot;>religion<&quot;>, the churches, the ritual, the culture.. But also, he finds the talking snakes funny and the though of a man walking on water and respawning 3 days after his death completly unbeliveable and absurd, he simply cannot believe that people actually think something like this happened. Somebody says to him about Noah's arc and how it existed, he would probably think that this person is either trolling him or being stupid.

I am pretty sure if a person being isolated from religion until he grows up, becomes an adult will definitey not believe in any religion.

I have a few arguments to back this up.

**1. People are Christians, Muslim or Jewish simply because that is the part of their culture and they have been brainwashed with the concept of their religion.**

I think that this is pretty obvious. Do you know any religious person who has analyzed every single religion, put the cards on table and said: <&quot;>Yeah, I think this religion is the true one, I will definitely pick this one<&quot;>?

Of course you don't. A christian is simply a christian because he picked up the religion from his parents and grow up in a culture sorounding it. Let's say a baby is born by christian parents, but they don't want the baby so a family from Iran adopts them. When grown up, this baby will either become an atheist or will be a muslim **simply because his parents which adopted him are muslims.** There is no way this baby would ever grow into a christian or a hindu.


**2. When people are still kids, it's the most easiest for them to pick up the behaviour by the people sorounding them.**

Think about parenting. You wouldn't say the word <&quot;>fuck<&quot;> or any swear word in front of your kid, because he will pick it up. I know many cases where parents were swearing in from of their kids, it's cute while they are small, but now their kids have big problems especially in school. If your kid watches television too much, he will get addicted and have problems with watching it the whole day when he gets a bit older.. 

**If we start a routine when we are younger, there's is a higher chance we will follow it later in our life, same with religion.**

Kids are taught about the concepts of hell, burning in enternal fire and a lot of other non senses, they fear that, and their brain doesn't want to burn in eternal fire  so it just accepts the fact that it has to follow christianity. Just think about it, this is this like a defensive mechanic, isn't it?


If you start smoking by the age of 12 the addiction is going to be a lot higher than if you started by 26. You grew up smoking.

Let's say by the age of 16, you were smoking for a total of 4 years. So you smoked 4/16 of your lifetime. A 25% of it.

If you start by 26 and smoke for 4 years, by the time you are 30 years old it would be 4/30 of your lifetime. A 13% of it.


Would it be easier to stop something which has been in your life for 25% of it or 13% of it?

The younger you start doing something, the more % it's going to be in your total lifetime, giving you a harder time leaving it.

Religion doesn't make you phyisically addicted, but still I believe you got my point.

Minors are taught about religion and they FEAR IT.


That's it. CMV.

I am abstracting from the question of whether any of these systems are true.

First, some vocabulary. A substance, for the rationalists, is something that can exist by itself, without depending on anything else for its existence. We normally think that there are many substances, and that these include everyday concrete particulars like cars and trees and so on. Substances have attributes, like being green or round or whatever, and they also have modes, i.e., perspectives from which we can view them.

The core claim of Spinoza's system is that the only substance that exists is God. Every other so-called <&quot;>thing<&quot;> is only a mode, or way of appearing, of God. God has infinitely many attributes with infinitely many modes, and all of these attributes and modes follow from God with ironclad logical necessity like that of 1+1=2. The only two attributes we are aware of are thought and extension.

Descartes accepts the claim that everything else depends on God for its existence, but he attempts to avoid the conclusion that God is the only substance by arguing that other things are substances in a secondary sense. This is clearly a weak distinction, so his position threatens to collapse into Spinozism.

Similarly, Leibniz argues that there are infinitely many monads arranged into a hierarchy with the most powerful monad, God, on the top. This also threatens to collapse into Spinozism because it makes everything other than God depend on God for its existence, which means that God is the only substance by definition.

So, Descartes and Leibniz collapse into Spinoza. CMV.

I’m really hoping there’s a good reason behind the status quo, but we’ll see. [It looks like there’s even less reason behind it than I initially thought, actually.]

*I am not here to start a religious flame war--if I am misunderstanding what is required to diagnose a mental illness, please let me know (I am not a mental health expert)!*

By *religious fundamentalist*, I am referring to someone whose personal religious beliefs are obsessive and interfere with one's ability to think rationally (e.g. someone being a creationist or belief in a need to <&quot;>save people<&quot;>).

From reading the Diagnosis section of wikipedia, it seems that [psychosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis#Diagnosis) is first diagnosed by ruling out improper medication and Delirium. From there, various symptoms are analyzed to find the specific type of psychosis the patient has. [Schizophrenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia) and [Delusional disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusional_disorder#Indicators_of_a_delusion) are two obvious canidates with the latter matching fundamentalists very well (unless one considers personal <&quot;>*messages from God*<&quot;> to be hallucinations, in which case Schizophrenia is more applicable).

I get sick maybe once a year, and I go to the doctor maybe once every other year if and when I get a mean bacterial infection.  In other words--I'm a rare sight at the doctor's office.  I have my daily aches and pains, I have periodic eczema from stress, I have back pain and all the other joyful pains associated with aging.  I feel like I'm a pretty average guy with regards to health issues.

Yet at the same time, I see an almost never-ending stream of friends and family members going in for some type of surgery or another.  Some are under the knife more often than others.  I'm talking about otherwise healthy people--no major diagnosed illness, no cancer, no MS, nothing except <&quot;>Going in for exploratory surgery for my ear pain<&quot;> or <&quot;>Getting ready for surgery on my knee<&quot;> or <&quot;>Having surgery for my deviated septum.<&quot;>

Going to the hospital is practically a daily part of these people's lives.  They don't have life-threatening illnesses.  They aren't terminally ill.  This has been going on for as long as I've known them on facebook--which is to say, years.

Am I missing something?  Is this some kind of cultural phenomenon that I'm not understanding?  Am I supposed to go to the hospital to get upper back surgery when I sleep in an awkward position?  Am I supposed to go find a surgical response to every fucking pain and inconvenience that I experience on a daily basis?

Then congress lowered taxes, cut back a lot of the New Deal programs, and balanced the budget. Allowing the free market to do its job after the war was what really got the US out of The Depression.

2rd7mg,"CMV: America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had",http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rd7mg/cmv_america_is_a_better_place_because_of_the_55/,1.420430059E9,"There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973.    
                 
Something in the ballpark of 45% of women who have abortions have more than one abortion.  
              
These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up.   
           
Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million.                         
One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems. Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues.  
            
America's innovation and education rankings would be lower. Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around. 
                        
(**Note:**I'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point, what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around. Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them?)         
               
**Was view changed?**  
Its a complicated issue. Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population?  Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive? Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics?          -(choppy writing, but i'm on 3 hours of sleep and stretched for time, give me a break)-   
        
                 
(Side thought: Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children. Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower? This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value. Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. *no that isn't a serious sentiment, i'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point* )    
                          
Then there is the next question. Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit? Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not.
            
Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one. This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country.  Modern technology like the internet must be considered.
                 
             
Yes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite. I am now confused and lost.                  
           
            
**EDIT:** 
             
I'll be without internet for a few days. I may end up returning and responding more but it won't be anytime soon.   
             
This was my first post to CMV. I apologize for a few things that I did that could be considered *rude* around here. I also see a few times where I got redundant. 
          
Thank you all for your arguments. This is a very critical place, I hope to learn how to better use it and come here more often. I feel I could learn a lot here.

&gt;There have been 4 jobs or activities which Man has engaged in throughout the centuries: Hunter/Gathering, Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services. What's next? What category can you imagine in which billions of people will be working in the future?
&gt;
It turns out that there is a final category. It is known as Unemployment. As Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services become more efficient in the coming months, workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line. At some point, Man's artificial economic system will necessarily collapse. When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man.
&gt;
The current jobless situation you read about in the news is not an ordinary part of the business cycle. It is the final stretch of the linear trend that began with the birth of our species.

There is also a Youtube video to go with this opinion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlQrYCacrKo&amp;spfreload=10

I do realize that this is a very unhealthy idea to have whether or not that the idea is true or not, I just have not been able to beat it myself.

I do disagree with Gade a little bit. I don't think it would kill everybody, but the some few people that still know how to hunt and gather would probably survive as well people who were rich enough to have access to a lot of resources to start out with before the economy crashes.

My argument is as follows:

1) The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none

1a) Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products

2) The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand

3) Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare.

4) A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.

4a) Since the majority of farms are large factory farms, I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. **However**:

5) Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing, which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.

My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers, and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether. Moreover, this practice would be much easier to <&quot;>evangelize<&quot;> than a vegetarian or vegan diet. Face it, meat is tasty (and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience)

Specifically, Arby's series of **<&quot;>We have the meats!<&quot;>** commercials ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCOwU_MxrtY)). For those unfamiliar, in this series of commercials, a deep-voiced man shouts at the audience through the duration of the commercial, getting louder as he goes, ending with Arby's current slogan of, <&quot;>We have the meats!<&quot;> It is loud; it is obnoxious; one gets the impression that the belligerent shouter's next move would be to slam the viewer's head into a table of meats, forcing them to eat whether they want to or not. For vegans and vegetarians, there may be a further degree of moral offense at the suggestion they be required to consume meats.

I think businesses like Arby's should refrain from putting up commercials like this because:

* They have an aggressive tone, suggestive of imminent physical conflict, which can be stressful to some viewers.
* They are excessively loud, which requires temporarily muting or turning down the TV's volume.
* They belittle the sensibilities of vegans and vegetarians who may happen to be watching.
* Business-wise, they dissuade potential customers by building negative associations with the brand.

I don't watch much TV these days, but these are probably some of the most obnoxious commercials I can recall seeing for a long time.

Saying these people shouldn’t be allowed to become part of the country, is the same as saying they are worse, because they were born on a different side of a line, and americans are better because of the side of the line they are born on. This is prominent in many ads and political champagnes, namely the slogan “Creating jobs for americans”. I understand why politics use this slogan, because they are trying to get americans to vote for them, but this slogan is also prominent in ads made by private corporations. As if creating jobs for americans is morally superior to creating jobs for people of other countries. The companies launching these ads may be trying to win in the american market, so they can sell more of their product, but the fact that this can increase sales shows that many americans hold the being born on one side of a line belief. I am not blaming the politicians or corporations running ads running these slogans, they are merely trying to win votes or make money from this mentality, but really it is the citizens that have the belief that they are better, because of the side of a line they are born on, that are at fault. Patriotism is really just this belief.

2rc3lu,"CMV: I believe the Major League Baseball regular season is too long in terms of the number of games played",http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rc3lu/cmv_i_believe_the_major_league_baseball_regular/,1.420407861E9,"In recent years I have become a big fan of Major League Baseball, watching dozens of games of my team (the Rockies) and following the playoffs. 

That said, the regular season is too long in terms of the number of games played.

Every team plays 162 games per season plus 29 spring training games immediately prior to the season's opening. That's roughly double the amount of games in the NBA regular season, and roughly ten times the number of games in the NFL regular season. This means that every team will play 5-6 games per week, except during the relatively short all-star break, for close to seven months (excluding the postseason). This has a number of negative effects. First, it leads to position players being injured through the wear-and-tear of playing so often. How often is a starting position player put out of commission for a couple weeks because of a tweaked hamstring or shoulder soreness or knee pain? Starting position players often have to be rested even when teams are in still in the hunt for a playoff berth just to avoid these wear-and-tear injuries.

Second, the sheer number of games hinders baseball's ability to be a more national sport like basketball or football. There are so many games that just trying to follow your local team will provide more than enough baseball for a year. I don't often feel motivated to watch a Yankees vs. Red Sox game on national TV when I have already seen 5 Rockies' games during the week. Compare with other major sports, especially football, where you can follow your team and still have plenty of time to follow the rest of the action. This is partially what allows football and basketball to be national sports and thus be more relevant in the national culture. The fatigue due to the number of games played dramatically reduces ratings for games on national TV.

Third, the number of games also decreases *local* television ratings and fan attendance at the stadiums. When there are 162 games, there's no sense of missing out if you miss a game or five during the season, because no individual game is of much importance in itself (save for the last 20-30 games of the season played by a handful of the 30 teams chasing a playoff berth in September). This is especially true in the mid-season slog during June, July, and early August. 

Fourth, it makes it harder for casual fans to become more devoted fans because it is just hard to follow a team with so many games to be played. It requires a great deal of motivation and time investment to become a more devoted fan, especially if your team isn't contending.

Fifth, and finally, the number of games means that the season must be very long in terms of time. Spring training starts at the beginning of March, while the World Series is played at the end of October. This causes two major problems. First, because baseball cannot be played in rough weather, and most teams play in open stadiums, this leads to a risk of games being cancelled due to snow in the early part of the season and the late part of the season and, crucially, during the playoffs. Second, this means that baseball must overlap with football at the end of the season which, given the utter dominance of football in the ratings and in sports coverage in the news, can only siphon fan attention and interest away from baseball right when it should be heating up.  

I believe the regular season should be shortened by at least 20 games, and perhaps as many as 50-60, to deal with the above five issues.

So, Reddit, change my view!

2rbp9f,"CMV: Animals Are Jerks",http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rbp9f/cmv_animals_are_jerks/,1.420429337E9,"I really get annoyed when people say that humans are some sort of deviation or disease. It is common for people to say things like, <&quot;>are we smarter than animals if we ruin the environment?<&quot;> or <&quot;>animals only take what they need and they establish a balance in their ecosystems.<&quot;> In the Big Friendly Giant Roald Dahl even said that humans are the only species that kills one another (which is demonstrably false). Agent Smith from the Matrix calls humans  a virus because we don't establish a balance with our environment. I think these views are false. Humans aren't inherently more selfish than animals we are just more successful. Animals rape and murder each other all the time. Chimpanzees even have full fledged wars with actual weapons. Animals don't choose to find a balance in their ecosystems, they take as much as they can but their environment forces them to limit themselves. Do you honestly wish to tell me that hippopotamuses, who bite each other's tails off to stop each other from reproducing, are somehow morally superior because they don't burn fossil fuels? Groups of male dolphins gang up on and rape female dolphins regularly. A group of termites doesn't care that it is in balance with the tree population, trees have just evolved to resist them. I don't blame animals, they lack the capacity to understand morality. To me it is not shocking how horrible and evil people can be. I am constantly shocked and pleasantly surprised by the incredible capacity people have to be good, which is actually unprecedented in the animal kingdom. For my point in hilarious comic form (credit to Zach Weiner of Saturday Morning Breakfast cereal) click [here](http://imgur.com/gallery/q1BUn).

Edit* The most common objection was in my use of jerks in the title. When I wrote this I was being informal and what I mean is that by our standards animals are jerks. However, it is not fair to use our standards to evaluate animal morality. The view I have is that people who claim animals are somehow morally superior (for some of the reasons I listed above) are wrong and animals are not morally superior to humans.

2rbjci,"CMV: In a perfect world, all police wear body cameras. If an incident occurs in which the body cam was not activated (by accident or not) the officer is guilty until proven innocent",http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rbjci/cmv_in_a_perfect_world_all_police_wear_body/,1.420426243E9,"Say an officer shoots a man. With body cam footage it shows the man was viciously attacking the officer and it is shown everything went accordingly. But if the camera was not recording, the word of the citizen trumps the officer, because why would the camera be off? The officer is hiding something by default and the citizen gets off.
There would be cases in which cameras malfunction during critical incidents. Let's give this a generous 5% failure rate. This would screw the cop 5% of the time. By today's standard, the civilians pretty much get screwed 5% of the time.
In this world, police activity would be virtually transparent and brutality would vanish. It would probably also lead to more stable recording equipment being produced. The outlier cases in which one individual is wrongly convicted would simply just switch from being civilians to being the officers. The same number of people would be getting shafted but with 100% removal of police brutality. How can this fail?

2rbjbx,"CMV: I believe the desire to remove gun rights from the mentally ill (to prevent violence against others) results more from stigma than rationality.",http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rbjbx/cmv_i_believe_the_desire_to_remove_gun_rights/,1.420426235E9,"This argument is mainly about the association people have between mental illness and violence towards others. I happen to believe in a right to suicide, and was not intending to discuss that aspect of gun ownership here.

1. MI people already have a significantly smaller set of rights than the general population - they can be detained indefinitely without charge, forced onto medication, and banned from certain professions, all based on symptoms of an illness. If we want them to come forward and seek treatment, we should be very reluctant to remove further rights.

2. MI people are more frequently victims of violence, theft, and abuse than the general population. If anything, this gives them more of a need for self-defense. In addition, if the public knew those with MI could not have weapons, all MI people would have to choose between not discussing their condition publicly (which would only further the stigmatization) or announcing their defenselessness. Particularly in rural areas where police response times are slower, announcing you have no real deterrent to crime is dangerous.

3. While there is a slight correlation between mental illness and violence, most of this disappears if you control for factors that also make the general population more violent, such as a history of sexual abuse or drug use; furthermore, for some specific illnesses, like OCD, there is no reason to believe there will be a future of violence at all (yet this nuance is generally absent from public discussion).

4. Most people have been biased to associate mental illness with violence by unfair media coverage. Most people would be outraged to read, as a last sentence in a story concerning gun violence, “The suspect is a Jew” or “The perpetrator is reported to be homosexual”; however, it’s very common to find, despite it also being mainly a circumstance of birth/environment, “The suspect had a history of mental illness”. Not only do people tend not to complain about this type of reporting, it’s often praised for bringing attention to the need to help the MI.

5. (Similar to #1 but more specific) MIs that cause suicidal or paranoid thoughts often give potential patients specific reasons to want a gun with no intention of turning it on others. While deciding whether there’s a right to suicide would be another, much longer, discussion it has to be admitted that removing gun rights from people who seek treatment would deter suicidal/paranoid MI from doing so.

6. Mental health diagnosis suffers from biases in gender, race, religion, and culture - meaning the proposed removal of rights would discriminate against more than just the MI.

7. MI has never been proved to be a causal factor for violence, only a correlate. To remove people’s rights on this basis, until we have a more detailed understanding of MI, seems unfair. For comparison: we could almost certainly reduce the rate of drunk driving fatalities by temporarily removing the travel rights of everyone who went to a bar on a Friday night and placing them in a drunk tank until noon Saturday; however, we don’t do this, because it would be a violation of the rights of those who would choose to walk home, take a cab home, or stay under the legal limit of intoxication. By that same logic, while we could almost certainly reduce the rate of gun violence by keeping all MI people away from all guns, this would be a violation of the Second Amendment rights of the MI who were in control enough not to commit violent acts.

The amount of excess money going into this one day is absurd; DJs, flowers, photographers, clothes, matching shoes, centerpieces, food. It's creating rifts between the families and even the bride and groom with regard to what clothes everyone thinks they should wear (as per each families <&quot;>traditions<&quot;>). My gf is really pissed about how much she has to spend on bridesmaid dresses that she will only wear once, which shoes to go with them, all to satisfy the brides whims. It's basically destroying their friendship because this woman doesn't seem to give any thought to how forcing her friends to spend all this money is affecting their lives, only how it will all look at the ceremony. Basically it just seems like these weddings are only good to make people who previously cared about each other, resent each other. I can understand wanting your day to be special, but can't it just be special because all your friends and family are together, rather than striving for ridiculous excess? Why is this something so many insist on and why should I be ok with it?

They will care about how people respond to them, but since it's largely negative they will stoop down to the same level rather than go to any high ground since they are not linked to an identity.

Surrounding the entire site there's a general pessimistic group mentality, and people are subconsciously encouraged to take part of it in order to feel like they are a part of the group. Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate, women, SJWs, casual gamers, Jews, and any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups.

On boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof. Things about e-celebrities will start as rumors, ideas about them or things will get taken out of context and it will be posted continually until it's taken as fact.
It will reach conspiracy theory levels of <&quot;>proof<&quot;> where people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a group-effort that's uncovering something.

Surrounding yourself with this will in general make you into a more pessimistic, negative and possibly depressive person.

I'm not saying that every person who browses 4chan is depressed or negative, but that the majority of them are affected negatively by browsing the site.

Thinking that you are unaffected by this doesn't necessarily mean you are, but instead means that you are unaware of how much it affects you.

John dies, but it is on the note that he didn't sacrifice his freedom, leading to a heroic ending for him akin to Cyrano de Bergerac: Cyrano didn't lose his *panache*, and John doesn't lose his freedom.

 Bernard Marx and Helmholtz Watson are both exiled to Iceland--but ironically, it is a place of complete creative freedom, unsupervised living, and more of a reward than a punishment--a paradise for non-conformists. 
Marx reacts to this with displacement, satirising (in my view) those who are over-reliant on government protection and sanctioning, while Watson views it as an opportunity. Regardless, the ending was hardly sad.
