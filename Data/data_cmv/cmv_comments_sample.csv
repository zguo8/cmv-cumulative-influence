181jmd,1,c8b2w35,181jmd,1.360261127E9,JOberlander,1,6,"Interestingly enough, they did exactly this in the U.K. about thirty or so years ago.  It all seems logical and practical and like it should work.   Then they decided that legally, ownership was satisfied if you could own something at all.  So handguns were turned in in huge numbers and you were allowed to keep rifles and shotguns.  Then it was shotguns only.  Then you could only keep them if you had a proven use for them like on a farm or similar.

Thirty years later and the inventers of most of our modern arms and the people who helped us the most in WWII are completely castrated.  Firearms are essentially gone and crime is out of control.

So what was the critical difference?  As was pointed out, it's that your argument pre-supposes that firearms are a priviledge and not a right.  You go into the creation of the list with a view that logically will lead you down this path.  But let's get into each statement/idea.  Because some are good, and some are not.  And this isn't really abot how you set up the argument so much as the individual points.

1 - This sounds great.  But this is alrady what happens with concealed carry permits.  A smarter approach would be to make a nationwide standard and database for CCW permits (it's a hodge-podge of conflicting laws currently and some states accept others, some do not),  Also, make a concerted effort to promote such permit ownership to our youths (say, training leading up to a full permit at adulthood) and as part of self-defense programs and so on.  We need more firearms in the hands of good, trained citizens.  

2 - Absolutely.  We do this in California already to buy any firearm.  But the issue again is every state has its own rules and laws.  There needs to be one database and one standard for all states.  I know I'm a big proponent of States rights, but in many ways, the patchwork of laws creates more headache that it's worth when we're trying to tackle a natiowide problem. 

3 - Unfortunately this is completely unworkable.  Given that you can reload your own ammo for pennies a round, and hundreds of millions of rounds are already in private hands, it's never going to happen. 

4 - Correct.  People will just load their own or drive across town to where it's not taxed.  TO make this work, it would have to be one law for the entire U.S.  But then there's issues with unfair taxes vs states rights and that would simply take decades to deal with in the courts.  Federal regulations are one thing, but adding an <&quot;>ammo tax<&quot;> which it would be called, is a political quagmire.

5 - We already do this with CCW permits.  The issue is that we have so many areas where you can't carry it or you can't carry it in across state lines (permit not seen as valid) that too many people leave them at home or in their cars or someplace other than on their person. This also needs to be cleaned up at the Federal level.  A higher level permit as you suggest would possibly let you carry in such paces, like bounty hunters and guards do. Promote this as possibly some sort of deputy corps to help out the overworked police.

6 - They already do this in most states.  The issue is... wait for it... the states that don't.

7 - Unworkable, really.  

8 - This is almost the law in some states already.  I see no issue with it, really.  As a firearm owner, your responsibility to secure it is exactly that.  Fines should seem appropriate.  But then again, if they steal your entire safe, it shouldn't be entirely your fault.

9 - Lastly, this is a must.  A good example of this sort of problem in the past was civil rights.  When you left it up to every city and state to have different laws about voting rights, laws, police enforcement, and so on, it was a social and emotional nightmare.  Only when you made it one law for everyone did we get compliance and the start of a workable system.",1,c8bfuhw,null,,0.05,0.879,0.071,0.8286,18,6,15,35,74,80,58,104,207

Yes. My proposal in this CMV *explicitly* presupposes that a revision of the 2nd amendment is warranted. That presupposition [is discussed in another CMV](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17qbhy/i_think_the_2nd_amendment_has_been_interpreted/).

&gt;[Licensing] is alrady what happens with concealed carry permits. A smarter approach would be to make a nationwide standard and database for CCW permits...

Yeah. But I propose licensing for ownership, not just CCW. By the way, why is it considered a right to own a gun but a privilege to carry one in public? CMV, but I think this fact is one of many chinks in the sanctity of the second amendment's armor.

&gt;We need more firearms in the hands of good, trained citizens.

I implore you to [start your own CMV](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/submit) on this very claim. 

&gt;[Ammo licensing] is completely unworkable. Given that you can reload your own ammo for pennies a round, and hundreds of millions of rounds are already in private hands, it's never going to happen.

Fair enough.  But I still disagree that this is the proper way to address the actual problem of violence and gun crimes. Changing The Constitution will in no way solve the underlying problems of our society.  I'm also wary of changing it from a proactive statement to a restrictive one.  We tried that with prohibition and violence skyrocketed.  It's supposed to be a Bill of Rights, IMO, and not a Bill of Restrictions.

&gt;Yeah. But I propose licensing for ownership, not just CCW. 

Effectively your proposal would turn gun ownership into a CW permit process.  Which is fine, IMO, if it allows you to exercise the same privileges as a CW permits currently do.   Perhaps a compromise would be that you can have them similar to a CW permit outside of your property, but on your property, you need no such permit.  I'm not sure how to possibly word that, though.  I'm no lawyer.  

&gt;But I think it's worth a discussion, and perhaps the raw materials should be subject to regulation.

It really isn't worthy of discussion, though, since the technology to make ammunition is over a thousand years old and anyone can do it in their garage with fairly basic tools and machinery.  You also can't really ban lead and other metals, either.  In fact, in our own Revolutionary War, people melted down toys, silverware, and other items to make ammunition due to such bans.  Going after the ammunition is highly unlikely to work.

&gt;That gives me the willies.

There will of course be exceptions, but I wager that the reduction in overall crime will be more than offset by those who are registered, trained, and are helping the police.  The number of incidents by such people per year, currently, is less than ten, nation-wide.   

&gt;Why is displaying your license to be served at such places as firing ranges, gun stores and gun shows unworkable?

However, the mental health evaluation you suggest sounds like it would have more room for abuse and would have a tendency to be expensive for the potential gun owner (if you're thinking about an appointment with a certified psychologist).

Paperwork demonstrating transfer of ownership, similar to what we do for cars, also sounds like a good idea.

I don't think a gun owner should be held accountable if one of their guns is stolen and used in a crime any more than a car owner would be held accountable if their car were stolen and then used in a crime. However, as with cars, if you fail to properly transfer ownership of a gun and that gun is used in a crime, there should probably be some consequences for you, though obviously not as severe as for the person who actually perpetrated the crime.

I don't think that owners of <&quot;>semiautomatic handguns, assault weapons or large magazines<&quot;> should be subject to <&quot;>frequent and intrusive recertifications.<&quot;> The license/background check, if we instituted one, should be the same as for a hunting rifle. I could be convinced otherwise if research showed that semiautomatic handguns, etc. were more likely to be involved in a violent crimes, accidents, and/or suicides than hunting rifles and shotguns, but as far as I know, such data does not exist for the US--in large part because the NRA keeps shooting itself in the foot (ha!) by blocking the funding of organizations that want to do this kind of research. I seem to remember a post recently with data from another country (Australia maybe?) showing that deaths caused by assault weapons, etc. were negligible compared to deaths caused by hunting rifles and shotguns. 

The only gun I own is a semi-automatic .22 caliber handgun with a 10-shot magazine that I won in a raffle when I was 16 (I didn't technically own it until I turned 21--my father did). I enjoy shooting targets with my dad, but it's not my favorite thing in the world. I do not believe that my .22 <&quot;>semi-automatic<&quot;> weapon makes me a dangerous person. I also do not believe it will help me stand up against a totalitarian government (nor do I fear the US turning into such a government in my lifetime). However, I would like to keep it and would rather not pay several hundred dollars for a license or undergo rigorous psychiatric examination in order to maintain ownership of my property. If reliable research showed that my type of gun was 10 times more likely to be involved in a violent crime than a hunting rifle, then I would reluctantly deal with the new regulations or (more likely) sell my gun to someone who was willing to deal with the regulations. I wouldn't raise much of a fuss because I like reading and Reddit more than shooting. But my father would be very upset since his primary hobbies do involve guns, and it would make me sad to see him go through the type of bureaucracy that you propose, especially without a reasonable demonstration beforehand that the changes would actually result in a reduction of gun violence.

I think the reason we haven't had to protect ourself from a dictator is because we can. You take that away, and we're powerless. Also criminals in possession of an illegal gun, could break in anywhere with the comfort of knowing they won't get shot. If I was a criminal, this would be good for business.

EDIT: Also everyone should really look up the statistics of people getting killed with guns. It's basically negligible.

I think your intervention is unlikely to change anyone's usage of the word *retard* unless you have a strong relationship with them and they respect you. However, as a teacher, I would say you have a moral obligation to speak out against the negative usage for the benefit of students who might be offended by another student's use of the word, even if the student who misuses the word is unlikely to change their behavior. I see at least 5 distinct categories of the types of situations you are likely to encounter:

**1. Outside the classroom; a stranger uses *retard* negatively.** This happens while you are at a restaurant or out shopping. You have no relationship with the person who is speaking. In this situation, I don't think you have a moral obligation to do anything, and if you did choose to reprimand the stranger, I doubt they would take it well. In fact, they may be so enraged that a stranger is encroaching upon their <&quot;>free speech<&quot;> that they start using *retard* more often and more vocally, political correctness be damned. 

**2. Outside the classroom; a coworker, friend, or family member uses *retard* negatively.** In this situation, I would say that the moral obligation to say something is higher, since there is at least a chance that your intervention will make a difference in their lives and the lives of those who hear their speech. Plus, it's good to tell people you like when they are behaving like douche bags, just like you would tell them if they have spaghetti sauce all over their face.

**3. Inside the classroom; a student you have a good relationship with uses retard negatively.** Same as number 2. You have a good chance of changing this student's behavior. You should say something.

**4. Inside the classroom; a student you don't know very well uses *retard* negatively.** For the sake of argument, let's say that this student does not have a disability, but there are students in the classroom who do. Let's also say that this is a very strong-willed student, and there is approximately 0% chance that you will change this student's behavior. Nevertheless, you should say something about why this language is hurtful and wrong for the sake of the other students in the room--especially those who might be hurt by these words. You are the teacher. You have more power than the students. It is your job and moral obligation to stand up for all your students--especially when they cannot stand up for themselves.

**5. Outside the classroom, but inside the school; a stranger uses *retard* negatively.** Say you're in the cafeteria monitoring kids during lunchtime, or say you're just walking down the hallway, and you hear a kid you don't know saying that his/her test next period is <&quot;>retarded.<&quot;> This is a tough one. The first thing to do is check to see if any of your mentally challenged students (or any students you know to have mentally challenged friends or family members) are within ear shot. If so, then you may need to say something for reasons expressed in #4. If not, make a quick judgment about the speaker: does this seem like the kind of kid who is more likely to do something because a teacher tells them to (someone who naturally respects authority)? If so, then you have a higher chance of changing their behavior, so perhaps you should say something for reasons expressed in #2. Does this instead seem like the kind of kid who is more likely to do the exact opposite of what an authority figure tells them to do? If so, then perhaps the best thing to do is keep silent, for reasons expressed in #1.

Edit: To delve into this:

Humans slaughter and eat animals just as other animals will slaughter and eat animals. It is something that is in our nature to do since we need meat in order to gain certain nutrients which is generally unobtainable through other means of food supply. One could argue that we are able to actually receive those nutrients through other means, especially now that we better understand the benefits we receive from different types of livestock, but when you consider that most of these developments are modern, eating animals is something that has always been beneficial to the human race provided that we don't push a species to extinction like we have in the past.

Hunting an animal and killing it is a much different activity than having sexual intercourse with an animal. There is no way that a human can tell whether an animal is interested in such an activity and there is no survival reason to actually have sex with an animal since a human cannot reproduce with an animal. From that perspective, there is nothing gained from having sex with an animal. The only benefit from that is the sexual pleasure one achieves from doing such an activity, which would be similar to that if one had sex with a human (depending on the person).

No animal ever consents to being slaughtered, but it is something that benefits the one slaughtering the animal and eating it. It's something done for survival by animals and humans alike. Animals will actually slaughter humans and eat them for survival as well, thus it is a necessary evil. In some cases, the slaughtering of an animal could actually be in self defense. One is not going to have sex with an animal in self defense (or at least that would be a very strange situation).

There are no real parallels to draw between sex and slaughtering of animals. It's not a relevant topic, but if we were to draw any comparison between the two I would say it would be this.",,null,null,,0.078,0.821,0.101,0.6941,4,3,7,8,39,21,34,82,110

I think this argument frequently arises from those who are stridently opposed to homosexuality. My response is not to argue against bestiality or zoophilia, but to point out that it's probably best to cross that bridge when or if we come to it. Zoophiles do not seem to exist in large numbers. They are not seeking equal rights. An overwhelming societal taboo exists with respect to zoophilia.

In other words, I think the <&quot;>so why can't I marry my goat<&quot;> argument is a red herring that is all the more offensive for equating homosexuality (which is a normal state for a percentage of humans and some other mammals) and zoophilia, which is quite rare and almost universally viewed as resulting from psychological disorder.

However, going down this road may miss the point. [I argued this subject with a person with deep convictions about gay marriage](http://www.differhonestly.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1551) a few years ago. I summarized his argument as follows, and he confirmed my assessment of his position.

&gt; At first glance, this whole goat line of reasoning Arlo has been making seems offensive and stupid. But it actually reveals the objection to gay marriage quite clearly.

&gt;It is not sensible (to me) to recognize marriage between a person and a goat, because, among other reasons, a goat is not a person. A marriage between a person and a goat would be meaningless!

&gt;<&quot;>But,<&quot;> says Arlo's argument, <&quot;>in allowing men to marry men, you make marriage equally meaningless. Why do you get to redefine marriage to permit same sex unions, but I cannot redefine it to permit unions between men and goats?<&quot;>

&gt;It seems clear to me that Arlo knows that it is absurd to consider a marriage between a man and a goat. What he is trying to say is not that homosexuals are akin to goats, but that a marriage between a man and another man is equally absurd because of what he thinks the word <&quot;>marriage<&quot;> means.

It's also the case that people who think like Arlo in the passage above tend to have an absolute view of morality: namely that it exists independently of human interpretation. They see evolving social perspectives on such things as gay rights as signs that we are <&quot;>falling<&quot;> from God's grace, and they see my willingness to adapt morality to fit new information as unacceptable.

**1. Bestiality is inherently harmful to the animal since the animal cannot give consent, and it can sometimes be harmful to the human as well.** The first half of this argument has already been addressed by /u/Snorrrlax. Most modern discussions of sexual ethics in secular societies center around the idea of consent. We often say that an individual is not capable of providing consent if their decision-making ability is impaired (by drugs, alcohol, etc.) or if they are not developmentally ready for sex (children), or if there is a large power gap between partners (prisoners in a prisoner-guard relationship, students in a student-teacher relationship, low level employees in an employee-boss relationship, and, once again, children in an adult-child relationship). Animals will always (at least for the foreseeable future) have lower intelligence and less power than a human who wants to have sex with them, so it can certainly be argued that animals cannot give their consent, and thus it is not true to say, <&quot;>no one gets hurt,<&quot;> because the animal gets hurt. If a person puts peanut butter on their genitals so that a dog will lick them, the dog cannot be said to have consented to sexual activity. The dog simply wants peanut butter. A person is also at risk for being harmed in many kinds of bestiality. In the example above, the dog may bite the genitals. When the animal penetrates the human, the human is at greater risk for harm. If the human penetrates the animal, the animal is at greater risk for physical harm.

**2. Bestiality takes human connection out of sex.** Many people would agree that the most pleasurable and most spiritual aspect of sexual intercourse is the profound connections with another human being. This is why mediocre sex with a person can be better than masturbating alone (even though it's often easier to get the friction, vibration, and pressure right when you do it yourself) and why mediocre sex with someone you like can be better than <&quot;>good<&quot;> sex with a stranger or someone you don't really care for. Bestiality lacks this human connection. Of course, the same could be said for masturbation, the use of a sex doll and/or other <&quot;>toys,<&quot;> and pornography. Many religious people are against pornography and (sometimes) masturbation, in addition to being against homosexuality and bestiality. There is no place in the Jewish or Christian scriptures that specifically prohibits pornography or masturbation (though a poor reading of passages about onanism and the uncleanliness of wet dreams could be interpreted as a prohibition against masturbation). However, passages about lust and <&quot;>adultery of the heart<&quot;> can reasonably be applied to watching pornography and fantasizing while masturbating. However, I think the bigger reason why most (I think) Christians are against pornography and many are against masturbation of all kinds is because these acts--like bestiality--lack a human connection, and thus <&quot;>fall short<&quot;> of God's <&quot;>plan<&quot;> for human sexuality. For your context, the nice thing about this argument against bestiality is that it can't be applied to homosexuality. You could argue that anonymous gay sex through a <&quot;>glory hole<&quot;> in a public restroom lacks a human connection, but this hardly describes the average sex life of an LGBTQ person today.

**3. The <&quot;>ick<&quot;> factor.** Bestiality, like homosexuality and incest (according to some), is just gross. BLECH!!! How could you even think about such a thing! Obviously, this argument doesn't have much logical weight, but it's important to mention because even though it's the least logically convincing argument, it's the most intuitively and emotionally convincing argument. 

When your friend threw the bestiality example at you, I doubt that agruments 1 &amp; 2 were on his mind. Probably, the <&quot;>ick<&quot;> factor and the Biblical prohibition against bestiality were on his mind. But the ick factor isn't a rational argument, and the Biblical prohibition shouldn't matter to you if you are not religious. The next time this happens, you can focus on how reasons 1 and 2 *could* be reasons why bestiality is wrong (even if you don't agree that bestiality is wrong or agree with reason #2 for why it might be wrong) and then show how these reasons don't apply to gay sex (with the possible exception of the glory hole example, which is not in any way representative).",1,c8d6qvx,null,,0.098,0.835,0.066,-0.9455,15,4,23,29,282,244,69,184,237

An ethical zoosexual would know that doing anything to hurt an animal would be wrong. People who hurt others and claim <&quot;>love<&quot;> are crazy, fucked up people. A man who hits his wife every night doesn't love her does he? So then why would you compare an unhealthy way or acting to something that doesn't harm the animal and wherein the animal even enjoys it?",,null,null,,0.225,0.655,0.12,-0.9831,3,3,5,6,30,32,15,26,41
189t2t,50,c8ju57k,c8jo47h,1.361556816E9,2Fab4You,,1,"Yes, I'm sure sometimes the animal does in fact enjoy it and want it, the problem is that you can never be sure because you can not communicate in a 100% certain way.

You can manipulate a child into thinking it wants something and act upon it, just like you can manipulate an animal into thinking it wants something and acting upon it. Also, just like with humans, an absent <&quot;>no<&quot;> does not mean <&quot;>yes<&quot;>. Just because the animal doesn't bite you or run away does not mean it wants to be treated that way or that it's good for the animal.

Sex means something to most animals, most often it has a connection to hierarchy in a pack. If you are alpha above the animal, it may feel like it has no choice but to do what you want and it will therefore not fight or walk away. This is extremely true in dogs especially who have a very strong sense of hierarchy, and are also some of the most common victims of animal sexual abuse.

Fully matured animals in the wild can take care of themselves, yes. Fully matured domesticated animals can not. They are dependent upon humans to feed them and take care of them. Also they may have grown up with a zoosexual, being taught from an early age that it is okay and a normal part of life. Most cases where humans have sex with animals it's a domesticated animal because a wild animal would rarely allow that to happen (the rarely even allow humans to get close).

I tried to find the study I mentioned previously, unfortunately I can't find it. But I can still say it again: there are studies that suggest that animals who have been involved in human/animal sex suffer psychological damage afterwards. In this study the animals had not suffered any physical damage, yet they showed clear signs of depression and changed behavioral patterns.",,null,null,,0.103,0.757,0.14,0.7671,9,2,18,12,65,50,42,47,91

Who said anything about using manipulation. If you think manipulation is needed for sex with animals, you are mistaken. I'm not quite sure how it works with men and animals, but for a woman, all she has to do is be naked and willing. Hormones do the rest.

*Fully matured domesticated animals can not. They are dependent upon humans to feed them and take care of them*

There was a pack of wild/stray dogs in our area as a kid who survived just fine for many years until the dog catchers and neighbors who like to shoot anything that moves came.

*Also they may have grown up with a zoosexual, being taught from an early age that it is okay and a normal part of life.*

How so? What do you mean by <&quot;>early age<&quot;>? Different animals mature at different rates. Anyone who has sex with beings that aren't sexually mature is abusive (This includes zoosexuals),  because there is serious risk of injury to the animal and most likely, the animal isn't even interested in sex at that time

*there are studies that suggest that animals who have been involved in human/animal sex suffer psychological damage afterwards.*

That's not proof. That would get you laughed out of any real science environment. Only because unless this <&quot;>study<&quot;> was done with a wide array of test subjects (including animals from non abusing zoosexuals), you don't really have any accurate data to go by. You only have sampled data from a selected group of animals that were most likely seized from people who abused them. Unless you can gather data from all sorts of zoosexuals, the study would be grossly inaccurate. Zoosexuals who actually do care about the welfare of thier partners will most certainly make sure that they are happy by any means necessary. I've seen plenty of happy partners and I've seen plenty of abused partners, there is definitely a behavioral difference.",,null,null,,0.129,0.748,0.123,0.3302,7,4,9,11,68,54,36,57,93

As I remember it the study was made with animals who were all from non-abusive zoosexuals (except for sexually, if you count that as abuse, which I do). The point was that they wanted to find out if there were any consequences to non-abusive sex with animals. Of course, it is still not proof of anything because it is just one single study, which is why I said it *suggested* there is psychological damage.

I was sexually abused as a child. I was still happy. I enjoyed the company of my abuser, when he didn't want me to do sexual stuff. But he was in a position of power over me and it never even occurred to me to say no or to fight him over it. He told me to do things so I did them.
I am convinced that at least some animals who live in the kind of relationships you talk about are in the same situation as I was then. The zoosexual might be trying their hardest to make the animal happy and make sure that they don't do anything to harm them or against their will, but an animal can never ever give consent that you can be 100% sure is real.

You, like most people confuse <&quot;>consent (Permission for something to happen or **agreement to do something**.)<&quot;> with <&quot;>informed consent (Same as other definition except you are **risk aware**)<&quot;>

Personally, I go with consent over informed consent and here is why:

Informed consent is required for legal situations (Courtroom, Doctor, etc), not sex.

Informed consent means that you are aware of **ALL** the risks when giving permission, not just some. So why is it that most people don't think you can catch herpes or genital worts so long as you use a condom (You can)? Why are there so many teen pregnancies? Why do people still lie to thier sex partners about thier STD history? Why do people lie to other people just to have sex with them? If informed consent should be required to have sex, than lying to someone to get them to sleep with you should be illegal as well and everything else I mentioned on that list and almost all the sex that everyone ever has had in the history of mankind is uninformed. Only in a perfect society would informed consent ever exist because people don't know all the risks in any sexual situation at any given time, they just think they do based off the only information that they heard from thier peers or personal social bubble (monkeysphere) as I like to call it.

*About women just needing to be naked and willing: That counts as telling the animal what to do if you are above them in the hierarchy. Body language is a way of communicating with animals and taking a posture where you invite the animal to sex counts in most species as telling them to have sex.*

I don't buy that for a minute. If I hold up my hand and arm in a position that appeared as if I was holding a knife and getting ready to stab someone, but didn't have an actual knife in my hand. People aren't going to assume that I'm about to stab someone just like a dog doesn't assume you want to have sex with it simply by being naked and in position. If I go to the bathroom and sit on the toilet while my dog watches, does that signal to him that it's ok for him to pee and poop there? If I go to my kitchen and cook myself a meal, does that signal to him to steal my food?

If you want to talk about pack order and manipulation of such, please tell me how a dog who is supposedly just turned on by naked women <&quot;>in position<&quot;> is manipulated into having sex, but isn't manipulated in using the bathroom where the alpha does his/her/thier business? 

There are plenty of women who want to try and have sex with dogs, there are probably 10 times more men out there who have a dog who they are willing to <&quot;>share<&quot;> (this act angers me btw). I am using this situation because pack order doesn't exist between 2 complete strangers, yet I've seen dogs go at it with strange women a number of times. Dogs are just as horny as people are, possibly even more so and don't care if it's a blanket, another dog, another person, a pony, a cat, a chair. To them, you are just friends with benefits. If you are turned on, your dog knows it and if they are turned on by you, they will try to hump you. Just a FIY, not all dogs are turned on by people, just like most people aren't turned on my animals. It really does just take the right combo of dog/human to make that sort of thing happen without any manipulation whatsoever.

The first two seem to be to a similar effect if I'm understanding correctly?

Your particular wording makes it tricky, which is more fun though. 

To your first statement, I might be inclined to argue that in cases of extreme psychological trauma i.e. psychosis, delirium, etc. a particular woman inflicted as such would be liable to make a decision as the result of an impairment. A decision that she would not have, and especially would have *wanted not*, to make otherwise. 

I believe this argument only has legs to stand on had your wording for the first statement been <&quot;>women may not be<&quot;>, instead of <&quot;>women are not<&quot;>. 'women are not' is an absolute statement. The argument I described above is strictly a selective condition, so it is invalid. 

The argument I'd feel inclined to propose to the second statement regards that of female to male rape (it happens. It's rare, of course, but cases have been reported). If a women were to successfully drug a man with something to inhibit his resistance, while arousing him sexually, say NyQuil and Viagra, idk, she could potentially inseminate herself, come to term, have the baby, and demand child support. She would also most likely win as I imagine it could be very difficult for a man to provide evidence that he was in fact raped. 

But just like before, this only holds true had you said <&quot;>may abuse this right<&quot;> but you did in fact say <&quot;>would abuse this right<&quot;> which again is absolute while the described hypothetical conditions are selective. 

That's all I got. If you were to decide that the *potential for* your conditions was enough to merit cautionary action, as opposed strictly to the *guarantee of* those conditions, I believe you may find the situations I described of interest. If not, I admit my inability to persuade you, because that's all I got. The barrels completely out of monkeys.",,null,null,,0.116,0.787,0.096,-0.6693,17,1,5,27,112,95,28,83,99

I believe that if we trust women to make their own decisions, they will act according to their belief system without outside influence and pressure from others' belief systems. A woman who is against abortion will not have one. A woman who believes life begins at conception will not seek in vitro fertilization. And a woman who believes it's immoral to bring a child into the world that you cannot care for either emotionally or financially can avoid that situation before the child is born.

Say a man and a woman have been married for 5 years.

The consequences of what? For a man it's the consequences of the decision to have sex. 

For a woman it's the consequences of deciding to have sex, deciding to carry the child to term, and deciding to keep and raise the child.

If the mother doesn't want to pay she can abort, or put the child up for adoption. Some states have drop of clinics where a mother can leave an infant no questions asked.

Well, I won't waste pity on someone who is simply living out a life they actively chose but you may find the following example interesting: I know of one case where a women did not want her child but the biological father was interested in raising it. She agreed to carry it to term. When it was born the mother wasn't asked to pay child support to the father. The whole thing was treated as an adoption. I wonder if in this case you would feel that the man has it worse because he has to pay AND care. Indeed he has it much worse as the mother has been allowed to abandon all responsibility absolutely. Do you feel that it is wrong that the mother did not have to face the consequences of having sex? If not, what do you feel makes the difference?

I bring this up because I think it illustrates nicely that deep down society can not free itself from the idea that women, when all is said and done, have no agency and that they ultimately need a man to provide for them.

You have it backwards. By engaging in sex, men AND women are choosing that financial burden. That is where the choice comes in.  
A woman can later choose to RELIEVE them both of that burden, but the choice to take it on is made when you take off your pants.

Incidentally, the relieving of that burden is a SECONDARY consideration - a side effect. The primary consideration is control over her own body.

You make a choice, you face the consequences. It is no longer <&quot;>your choice<&quot;> to escape those consequences. Through the actions and decisions of others you may, but you cannot simply say <&quot;>I don't want to face the consequences.<&quot;> The choice was made by the man.

You shouldn't ever legislate based on outrage, it will lead to bad laws, infant circumcision should be illegal because it violates the right of the infant to bodily integrity. It is currently legal only because of the influence some major religions have in politics.

&gt;Maybe you might like this view: don't agree with circumcision? Don't circumcise your child. That was easy, wasn't it? As some point certain people feel the need to legislate the private lives of other people and families based on what they themselves want.

No, I don't like that view because it treats children as property and not persons deserving of legal protection. If someone said to me <&quot;>don't agree with beating children? Don't beat your child.<&quot;> then I'd ignore the argument. I agree that the relative harm of beating children is probably greater than that of infant circumcision, however they are both still doing harm to the child, and absent good reason for allowing it both should be illegal.

These aren't grey issues either.

Abortion: The fetus has no right to the use of the mother's body.

Gay Marriage: There is no good reason to deny the legal protections for hetero couples to homo couples.

In fact (aside from seat-belt laws) these are all similar in that the interference of the religious lobby in politics is the only reason they are still being argued over.

Then I went to medical school and learned about how much, much more goes wrong with uncirc'd penises. Given the general tone of this thread, I will assume that I will be downvoted just for going against the mob's consensus. 

There are a whole slew of benefits for circumcision in new borns including a decrease in lifetime infections, a decrease rate of STD contraction and transmission. A decrease rate of penile cancer. A decreased rate of later in life complications with the foreskin such as phimosis and paraphimosis. In elderly people who need a catheter, the presence of a foreskin is prone to complications mechanically and infectiously. 

The negatives that are argued are 1) it hurts the child. 2) the child couldn't give consent. 3) It decreases sensation. 

The obvious retorts to these arguments are: 

1) The child's post birth neural and vascular systems are not fully developed for the penis, especially the distal penis where the skin is cut from. Also, post birth, as was mentioned earlier, the stress that birth has on the baby causes an increase of endorphines and adrenaline which have pain masking properties. 

2) Well children don't give consent for A LOT of things, including vaccinations. When a child of any age is challenged with a medical condition the parents are the ones responsible for the decision, not the child. And as was stated <&quot;>A parent cant force their 14 year old or (even newborn) daughter into having her breasts removed because she might benefit from it.<&quot;> Now that word <&quot;>might<&quot;> is problematic, and maybe irrelevant, since circumcision has been proven to decrease the incidence of those items mentioned above. More to the point of the example you gave, If a newborn, child, or even adolescent female were to be diagnosed with breast cancer it would not be the child's decision for treatment. The treatment for breast cancer, ESPECIALLY in younger females where it's more likely to be malignant and aggressive, is mastectomy. In families where there is an incidence of BRCA gene mutations, the therapy is *prophylactic* mastectomy, meaning they cut the breasts off before there's even a sign of cancer. please see [here](http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/93/21/1633.long). It also needs to be stated that if the parent's failed to act to treat the child and the child was at risk of developing breast cancer, or already had, the parents could be charged with neglect. Not saying they'd be persecuted, but charged...because it ultimately is the parents decision. - not to say I agree with this. I'm not even going to speculate on if the child can even understand what's going on to them in that situation for them to make a decision. 

So why not wait until boys are a little older for them to make the decision? Well, after the post natal period circumcision is no longer a simple cut, it actually becomes a full-on medical procedure. Risks then include severe bleeding and severe nerve damage. Doing it in that window right after birth decreases these risks drastically. If you want to get a little more technical, once the child goes uncut the and then decides that they want to be circumcised it is then classified as elective cosmetic procedure, which means it's being paid for out of pocket, not by insurance. 

3) Circumcision decreases sexual sensation. The only relevance I would give to this argument is that the decrease in sensation causes them to be be rougher to women during intercourse. With that said, so do condoms. And if nothing else, a decrease in sensation may lead to the man actually lasting longer...allowing the female to actually get something out of the encounter. 

My wife is a nurse and she describes elderly patients who ARE circumcised have problems with their extra skin, but let alone those who are not circ'ed are horridly under kept. If you cannot do daily maintenance and cleaning to that area it becomes a substrate for all types of cheesy stinky goodness.

About 100 boys die a year from circumcision. I mean, statistically, that's low, don't get me wrong, but if you took 100 kids from the school district you're closest to and shot them all, that'd be a huge tragedy. Either way, it's 100 kids dying totally unnecessarily. There's also several other medical complications that can arise from circumcision. Of those, I think the most interesting one is the need for a second circumcision. The main reason for this is because as babies/infants, the foreskin sort of adheres to the glans, similar to how a fingernail really enjoys hanging out with the nail bed. As the boy grows up, eventually the foreskin detaches and can be pulled back. (If it can't be pulled back at that point, it needs to be loosened or removed, and can turn into a legitimate need for a circumcision, though most of the time the problem can be corrected with the application of a topical cream.) If you waited until this point to get a circumcision, there's a much lower risk of complications. (Although iirc there's a slightly longer healing time as kids grow and heal quickly. Honestly, I think that's a better trade off, but for honesty's sake I thought I'd include it.) The problem is, by the time kids are old enough to make a rational decision, they get sort of opposed to doctors hacking away at their fun bits with a scalpel, imagine that.

For what you mean by damage, there's some evidence that circumcision can reduce sensitivity and orgasm intensity. Most people I've heard of having the procedure late enough in life to make a judgement call have said it isn't a huge difference.

I'm not going to circumcise any potential male children I have at birth for the same reason you're probably not going to have your potential newborn girl's ears pierced. (A procedure, by the way, that's more reversible, less expensive, less painful, less intensive and has a lower rate of complications than circumcision.) It's not medically necessary and it's not your body. If your kid decides that's something they want in the future, they can do it then, but you don't want to make the choice for your kid when they can't weigh in on the issue.

Also, the vast amount of abortions happen (in the UK and US) before the 12th week (around the 10th, i.e. by the end of embryogenesis). In most Western countries that's the general time limit - at which point neuronal migration has barely begun and the embryo's general, in particular neuronal capacities are lightyears away from that of a newborn infant. (There is an argument that pain reception sets in with the 24th week, whereas the first months of a newborn are the most agonizing of all.)

&gt; Point... don't get involved in people's decisions.

Child protection does that all the time, both indirectly via laws and directly. But you're right in one sense: If it's an adult's own informed choice about this body, nobody has the right to stop him.",,null,null,,0.073,0.927,0.0,-0.9281,0,0,4,4,45,35,9,22,42

Well if labiaplasty is as easy and cheap as circumcision, then yeah why not lol? I mean lets be real, excess skin no matter where it is located on the body is just gross looking. I'm sure it would make hygiene upkeep easier. I'm not familiar enough with the side affects to really comment tho.  
Tattoos and scarification and such are clearly pure visual changes that can have negative affects on the child in society and their career. They can cause infections and the tattoo would just stretch and fade as they get older too... lol.
  
Ah, so i finally get it, circumcision should be done in the same stages as abortions because you can't feel pain during that time (so they say.. but we really have no idea). Is that correct? would you object to it then?

This is, however, really irresponsible. Note that is is in fact illegal for that <&quot;>possible pedophile uncle<&quot;> to do anything to the child in his care. It is also illegal to drive a car that hasn't been inspected and deemed safe in the past certian number of years. There are laws in place to protect children from the risks presented in your ridiculous and unrelated example.

What you need to consider here is that a law against infant circumcision protects children against other people deciding to permanently alter their body in a medically unnecessary way.

&gt; I mean lets be real, excess skin no matter where it is located on the body is just gross looking.

Lots of children are funny-looking. Should parents take their big-nosed kid for a nosejob before the child is even old enough to express discontent with their appearence? This argument actually really upset me. You seem to be implying that a child should, from infancy, be taught that their appearence is important enough to get durgery to alter. The fact that something is <&quot;>gross looking<&quot;> to you is not a reason that parents should be able to choose surgical removal of a part of their child's body.

Furthermore, I actually prefer the appearence of an uncircumcised penis. I am American, and there was a time when I thought they were less attractive, but I have found that circumcised penises actually make sex worse.

&gt; I'm sure it would make hygiene upkeep easier

Feet without toes are easier to clean. Toes without toenails are easier to clean. Heads without hair are easier to clean. Ears without ridges, arms without armpits, armpits without hair, hands without fingers, mouths without teeth - they're all easier to clean. A vagina without labia would be easier to clean too. A foreskin can easily be rolled back and washed under. When I'm in the shower, especially in my dorm, which doesn't have detachable shower heads (those bastards!) I have to maneuver in near impossible ways to clean my vagina. I haven't gotten it removed yet, and don't plan to.

&gt;Tattoos and scarification and such are clearly pure visual changes that can have negative affects on the child in society and their career.

If a tattoo isn't in a place visible in clothing, it would make no difference in the child's career. I imagine you still think tattooing an infant is wrong.

&gt;They can cause infections and the tattoo would just stretch and fade as they get older too.

The fact that the tattoo would get uglier is so irrelevant I'm not going to counter. Circumcision can also lead to infection.

&gt;How is abortion completely autonomous about the MOTHERS body and doesn't involve the CHILD at all but circumcision isn't?

Consider that during pregnancy, a woman's body is wholly supporting the developing fetus. The complete reliance upon a mother, medically, means that abortion is a decision involving *her* body. Once a child is born, that child is, while being fed and cared for by a parent or other adult, able to live on its own. A baby is in no way physically dependant upon one person (anybody can sustain the life of a baby, while only one person is able to take care of a fetus - the woman carrying it.)

Also - very importantly - if you want anyone to take what you have to say seriously, stop punctuating with <&quot;>lol.<&quot;> There's amsolutely nothing funny happening.

Parents do seem to have pretty free reign over what happens to their children until they are 18. We live in a society that demands gender-egalitatianism, however, and why ought it be illegal to remove any part of your baby daughter's genitals, and commonplace and legal to do precisely the same thing to a baby boy.",,null,null,,0.078,0.794,0.128,0.9896,11,10,23,21,165,159,39,106,197

My brother came out about the child molestation of me, him and our next door neighbor when I was 22 years old after I came out about me being upset about circumcision. I suspect that my coming out about my feelings toward circumcision may have triggered my brother to come out about the molestation - I had actually repressed the majority of the memories as I was the principal victim out of the three of us. When I was a senior in high school after the last of a series of suicide attempts, and perhaps as a self-defense mechanism my brain literally forcibly forgot everything that night. I changed my name, and moved to a different town and never looked back until the investigators and therapists began digging them up again, which was, a very unsettling experience. I had to quit therapy early for fear of remembering some things I *really* didn't want to remember. And my refusal to testify could very well be considered a result of both reasons: not wanting to remember painful memories, and the feeling that my family was attempting to justify and blame my feelings about circumcision on him, and I felt that was very wrong.

It would be a major interference with religious freedom to ban it, so you would need a very compelling reason to do so. 

The second main argument is that circumcision of newborns is much less traumatic than circumcision at a later age: 

&gt; The newborn days represent what physicians call the ‚Äôwindow of opportunity‚Äô for circumcision. During this period, your son‚Äôs system has high levels of endorphins as well as adrenaline and cortisone. These prepare your son to deal with the stress of the procedure better than at any other time in his life. Circumcisions performed at an older age open the door for a number of complications and can cost over 10 times more.

Anecdotally, at Jewish brises the baby cries a little bit but seems fine pretty soon after. But I've heard that adult circumcision is major surgery.

Another argument in support is that there are health benefits to circumcision, but I think they're relatively minor for most men and probably about a wash when you factor in the small chance of health complications from circumcision.

I think the most common argument against circumcision is that people are uncomfortable with cutting off part of a child's body before they can consent. That's not that persuasive to me, though. It's just a subjective moral argument from faith, not any more or less compelling than the religious belief that circumcision is essential. Unless you can show tangible harm, the government shouldn't interfere.  

The best case for tangible harm is that circumcision reduces sexual pleasure, but there's not a lot of evidence to support this contention. Although there are some reports to the contrary, according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_effects_of_circumcision) the general scientific consensus is <&quot;>Circumcision does not appear to decrease the sensitivity of the penis, harm sexual function or reduce sexual satisfaction.<&quot;> 

So basically the argument against circumcision comes down to saying that the government should interfere with a major religious practice that makes other people uncomfortable, on the basis of very little scientific evidence showing it does harm and a fair amount of scientific evidence that it has health benefits. That's not a compelling argument, and it's not an appropriate place for government to intrude.",1,c8duis3,null,,0.135,0.754,0.111,-0.925,7,2,8,15,59,62,26,87,127

I think the practice of circumcising baby boys should be eliminated from our culture. However, I don't think that you can in any way relate female circumcision to male circumcision.

Here are the major differences, and the reasons why you will see female circumcision called female genital mutilation.

* Female circumcision scars women. Literally, their insides get lots of scar tissue. This is considered desirable for the man, as it makes the vagina extremely tight, and prevents the natural lubrication of the vagina. This causes dry sex, hence more friction for the male.

* Sex can be (and usually is) extremely painful for women, and oftentimes cannot be preformed the first time without making an incision in the vagina. Sex will be commenced before the incision heals.

* If infibulation has been done (sewing up of the vagina after removal of the labia), then the menses become extremely painful, and often do not discharge properly. This can lead to a back up of the menses, and cause the woman to become septic. There was one case where a girls menses were so backed up in her, that her stomach became visibly distended. Her family thought her pregnant, and killed her to maintain the family honor.

* If infibulated, urination is extremely painful, and can take a long time. Therefore women will often allow themselves to be dehydrated when in public, in order to avoid having to urinate. This is many hot arid countries, and while pregnant, causes many health problems.

* It can cause sterilization

* It causes extremely difficult labor when giving birth, due to lack of vaginal wall muscles (its all scar tissue), with each birth being more increasingly difficult. The female must be attended by a midwife familiar with circumcisions, as she must be cut open in order to give birth vaginally. The female will then be 're-sewn' shut for her husband)

Yes, it is the women perpetuating the circumcision. However, their reason for doing so is to ensure marriageability/virginity of their daughters, which still all leads back to men's view on women's sexuality.

That need not be true.

Ia includes only the removal of the clitorial hood, which is the anatomical analog to the male foreskin (and, due to the much smaller size and partial functional redundancy by the outer labia, possibly even less important). In the West it's even used as [elective plastic surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitoral_hood_reduction), and as therapeutic measure if the clitoris lacks exposure.

IIa is removal of the inner labia only, those too are not essential to sexual sensation. That too is used as elective plastic surgery in the West.

The key word in those two paragraphs is, obviously, <&quot;>elective<&quot;>. Also, the other parts of I and II are definitely destructive.

Type IV, the <&quot;>everything else<&quot;> category, contains the clitoral nick, which need not do more than the drawing of a drop of blood. Can't see how that has anything to do with men.

Infibulation is in WHO terminology Type III, which accounts for 15 % of worldwide FGM occurrence.

Not exclusively. There are a number of myths surrounding hygiene and health - and, of course, looks - prevalent in such areas.

Cattle feed most of their lives on hay, or graze in fields. This is very good for the land, as sod creates topsoil. using the same land for farming vegetables erodes topsoil, creates runoff, requires more irrigation, and tons more pesticides. Unless everyone starts eating the same dried grains that the cattle were eating (and they won't) farming vegetables is much more harmful to the land. 

And don't forget transportation and storage of said fresh veggies. Refrigeration unit trucks. Tons (literally) more waste, because it must be eaten right away or go bad. While cattle can be kept on the hoof until they are ready to eat, apples for instance, are harvested once a year, and must be kept in storage for the remainder of the year. I have seen more than 50 acres worth of apples sold for deer food because they were harvested a week late.

But really, is that 'just' self interest, or do we feed and shelter these animals out of genuine affection? ...Before we eat them.

I really don't think there is any ethical argument for eating meat. Overall efficiency, the things have nervous systems, ect. It's the realistic case that weighs more heavily for me. 

If we, collectively, didn't the most tasty animal species would probably die out, since they have been bred far beyond being able to survive in the wild. The sight alone would probably be too much for modern sensibilities.

So what, a zoo? Big fuckin' zoo. The last animal farms on the planet. We could make a thing out of it, building the barns in historical and regional fashions. All the kids would learn about the barbaric times when people would eat these magnificent creatures.

Still, billions of farm animals would need to starve, suffer and die before they're zoo eligible. What do you want to do with them?

Give them all the land that has been made available by efficiency. That is very unlikely to happen, people kinda like owning land. Most of the farmers you've pissed off because you've taken their animals. Rearing them is much more profitable, because anyone (not inner city) can grow their own veggies. But say you do succeed.

Say you create a ecological habitat for billions of cows, pigs, chickens and horses. Say they thrive. They expand to beyond the boundaries (Because that's what those creepy animals do, they have no sense of personal boundaries) They start killing precious vegetables. They clog traffic. 

The natural solution would be to introduce a predator. Wolves or lions or something. They find them super tasty too! So they too thrive. But having your lettuce nibbled is one thing, having to arm yourself on a tractor is just simply unacceptable. 

And if you go shoot the animals to curb population yourself, you might as well eat them. And if you're going to eat them, you might as well keep them close to food and shelter. If you feed them, you might as well breed them.

I really can't think of another sustainable solution. Maybe an overarching ethical system could work, where slowly the species is weened off meat. You'd have to indoctrinate children pretty heavily. Before long they grow up and outraged, and start legislating against private rearing of meat for consumption.

But wouldn't it mean that you can't have cats and dogs? I mean, even if you get them to somehow accept a veg diet, that food could probably feed a person too. Or half of one, or a quarter, I don't know the math I'm just saying.

What about forests? Orchards are much more efficient. 

How about that garden you do nothing with? If you grew some food there, you could probably feed another couple more people. Heck, why give people separate plots of land at all, if we can farm it mechanically and employ economies of scale. Also, only high rising buildings to live in.

I could go on, but you get the picture. I can't objectively compare the sizable happiness of a middle class westerner eating meat his whole life with five miserable dystopianists. 

Or 10 farm animals overfed but treated without real abuse. My guess is the average citizen is in no position to judge the treatment of the animals they eat. They don't regularly visit a farm, or raise animals themselves.

And, if not existing is 0, is their current state really suffering negative happiness? Or just the last couple seconds? You know, you can measure stress. And people do because stress reduces quality of meat. So they try to reduce stress. But it's not an objective science.

Going all the way down to insects we see less evidence of complet pain sensory systems and any kind of consciousness, so killing them simply seems to have less of an impact. I give everything the benefit of the doubt though, and try to end the life of any animal if i can avoid it.

If it doesn't bother you to kill for food, it doesn't mean that there isn't an objective moral truth, or even a society-prescribed common morality that differs from yours.

Natural selection applies for all genetically inherited attributes that improve the survival-rate of the offspring.

In the case of humans, this includes protecting, feeding and teaching relevant survival skills to the offspring all the way through childhood and adolescence - something that often takes place long after menopause.

In addition, as we are in essence pack-animals, this also applies not only to first generation offspring, but also to subsequent generations. In other words, The role of the Grand-parent and even Great Grand-parent has an impact on the long-term survival-rate of that individuals genes.

To generalize a bit, the longer an individual can stay alive and healthy enough to provide for its descendants, the better. Even if its merely in terms of baby-sitting.

Therefore, The best way to determine such conditions for prehistoric hunter-gatherers, is probably to look at modern day hunter-gatherer societies.

one such study (1) show that although average menopause sits around the age of 40,  the mean number of expected remaining years of life for  individuals that have reached the age of 45,  is 20.7, 19.8, and 24.6 for hunter-gatherers, forager-horticulturalists, and acculturated hunter-gatherers, respectively.

One would expect the corresponding Paleolithic figures to be of a similar magnitude, indicating heaps of time for nurturing both primary and secondary generations of offspring.

One <&quot;>*explanation for menopause is the <&quot;>mother hypothesis,<&quot;> which holds that it occurs because older mothers might profit more, genetically speaking, by investing resources in their existing children than in giving birth to new ones. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany, make the case for this in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology (AJPA), concluding that menopause is advantageous when a woman has aged enough to face an increased risk of stillbirth, birth defects and her own death in childbirth*.<&quot;> (2)

However, current evolutionary longevity theory suggests that selection pressure decreases rapidly after reproductive age (it's really difficult to select against deleterious alleles that 'emerge' later in life). (See this article for a nice overview: http://longevity-science.org/Evolution.htm)

So, while I said it only works work up to reproductive age, I was woefully oversimplifying.

I've never seen any research suggesting that the longevity of parents directly correlates to the survival of children up to reproductive age, but that makes sense. However, remember that not all traits have equal selective pressure; there is significantly less selective pressure against late-life deleterious alleles. So, even if what you do say is correct, our evolutionary history has optimized our bodies to use energy/nutrients from animal products while decreasing the frequency of alleles that exhibit negative effects at reproductive age. 

Certainly, if there is some 'parenting effect' that increases survival among offspring there would be selective pressure for those alleles which provide longevity, but selection would not be nearly as strong. So, late-life deleterious alleles would increase in frequency as you get further from reproductive age. In essence then, I believe my primary argument is still relatively sound: the consumption of animal protein, while it may not exhibit negative effects at or around reproductive age, may contribute to negative health effects at later life because selection is unable to effectively reduce the frequency of deleterious alleles from any source at late life. Thus, any 'digestive optimization' would decrease in effectiveness the further you get from reproductive age.

Thx for the article link, didn't read all of it, but it does make some valid points. I do however feel that it is rather inaccurate in describing that:

&gt;...while a lethal mutation with effects confined to people over the age of 80 will experience no selection because people with this mutation will have already passed it to their offspring by that age.

True that it will experience a lot less selection, but there would still be selection, if I'm not all confused. if you would take two families (or gene pools), one in which the older generation all dies instantly at 80, and the other where the older generation lives on...

Anyway, your reasoning is sound, and it is true that selection against latter life deleterious alleles is much weaker than during reproductive years.

&gt;the consumption of animal protein, while it may not exhibit negative effects at or around reproductive age, may contribute to negative health effects at later life because selection is unable to effectively reduce the frequency of deleterious alleles from any source at late life. Thus, any 'digestive optimization' would decrease in effectiveness the further you get from reproductive age.

Cant argue with the logic...
I did however find a scientific paper that had made a study on modern hunter-gatherer societies and claimed that:

<&quot;>*degenerative deaths are relatively few, confined largely to problems early in infancy.‚Äù Heart attacks and stroke ‚Äúappear rare,‚Äù and the bulk of deaths occur when the person is sleeping and are free of obvious symptoms or pathology. Most ‚Äúdegenerative‚Äù deaths are attributed to ‚Äúold age.‚Äù ‚ÄúIllness‚Äù is the main cause of death among all age groups and all populations, except for the pre-contact Ache (supreme hunters), and the authors break illness into different categories. The big killers were infectious respiratory diseases, things like pneumonia, bronchitis, and tuberculosis. Gastrointestinal illnesses also did a number on them, accounting for 5-18% of deaths, with diarrhea (probably stemming from parasites and coupled with malnutrition) taking the lion‚Äôs share. Violence was also a significant killer... it destroys the other common argument that an evolutionary diet high in animal products might still be harmful because we didn‚Äôt evolve to live past forty*<&quot;>

To eliminate the crux of your first item, animal welfare, I'd point out that while this is an issue, especially when we see clearly egregious mistreatment of animals, it has no impact on your question. The fact that people can mistreat animals in a farm setting should have no direct impact on whether you eat meat in general. 

I'm not sure if you're aware of them, but so called 'puppy mills' are centers where they mistreat dogs and other animals you might get as a pet. That argument would be exactly the same to saying that we shouldn't have pet dogs because it's possible some people mistreated some animals in order to breed, raise and sell them.

Next, environmental impact and efficiency. If we accept that it is possible for an animal to be bred properly, live comfortably, and later slaughtered and butchered in a humane way -- something a lion or other carnivorous or omnivorous animal certainly wouldn't consider -- then what are we arguing exactly? Animals walk the earth and use resources as they do. An animal takes up the same amount of resources in a season whether it is in a farm or in the wild. Should we say that those animals should never exist so that the earth saves resources? Or, put another way, what's our goal here, to simply save resources of an inanimate object, or to live in a sustainable way? The earth has a certain sustainable amount of resources, and given sustainable farming practices, these can be continually used for everyone to survive, animals, plants and humans included. The earth has sustained carnivores for millions of years, so we can see that eating meat in general has a long history of sustainability.

Lastly, you may believe that a vegetarian diet is no less healthy than an omnivorous diet, but that's not always true. There is no way of getting around the fact that humans were born omnivores - any argument to the contrary is simply incorrect. Some people can eat only a certain subset of the food we were designed to digest and get by fine, others have serious issues when they move to this diet. I'd be happy to link you to several articles mentioning health issues depending on a person and the veg and fruits they eat if you'd like, but you likely know very well that if you're not careful you can end up short on certain vitamins and minerals. There's a reason for this. Certain people will experience a lack of energy more than others on this diet, certain people will experience anemia or calcium or b vitamin deficiencies more than others on a vegetarian diet - they should not feel uncomfortable or morally sick for wanting to live a life where they are living the way they were designed to live.

So now lets ask why we should eat meat. I eat meat because it not only tastes good, but I feel more energetic when I'm eating meat. I get anemic without meat. I do not feel really full without meat. I do not feel as healthy when I'm not eating meat. Thus, for many people there are non-taste arguments for eating meat, and the way you choose to live as well as your personal moral perspective should not be forced upon them; case closed.

In a situation where you do not appear to disagree with many other facts on the ground - that we are able and have evolved eating meat as well as vegetables, that depending on your level of access to some legumes you may or may not be able to afford to live healthily without a little meat or derivatives - I mean these alone disprove your statement - these are valid arguments for eating meat (or perhaps having a balanced diet - which optimally should contain some level of meats). 

After loosing a previous post I wrote to you in a well timed windows update, I wasn't going to take the time to respond because of a mix of boredom and what I think is insight into who I'm arguing with, but well, here I am, so let me lay out what I think your issue is here.

I think your temperament and style of argument speak clearly about what this is to you. You were no balanced party on this subject, who found out some facts and decided having balanced the information to make a choice for vegetarianism. You're an ideologue, having likely been pushed at a very young age to live a lifestyle - you're someone who looked for the facts to fit his conclusion after the case was decided. You didn't post here to open your mind, you posted to reinforce your stereotypes and arguments for your chosen position. There's not any evidence or logic or statement I could make that will change your mind if you're not open to having it changed.

Thus, what I read in this thread is you resorting to talking down, and using fallacious arguments instead of directly refuting what people are putting up. Your 'tummy feelings' comments, for instance, are you clearly labeling and discounting my arguments out of hand: I may or may not have made a bad argument to your statement, but I think your general form of refutation is more about you reassuring yourself of what you already believe than you trying to argue against my and other people's points.",1,c8fs6mn,null,,0.076,0.834,0.09,0.7594,18,0,9,29,65,52,44,82,115

&gt;That sounds as close to a valid argument for eating meat as I think I'm going to get out of you.

No no, the point i'm making is that although you may have struggled it is very possible to manage to be health while not eating meat. That fact that some people are not healthy when not eating meat isn't an argument for eating meat, but it is a suggestion that they should be not eating meat better, so to speak :-) (i.e. eating more healthily with the food they have available to them)

I think a very tiny proportion of the world 'need' meat in their diet. If you can suggest some specific medical conditions where that's the case, I'm all ears, but I haven't heard of any. You definitely can get all the nutrients you need in your diet from vegetarian sources, that is a well known fact these days.

&gt; I think that shows that this is an emotional topic for you, not one you're willing to have challenged with evidence.

I'm very willing to have my view challenged with evidence, that's the whole point of this thread, but if you're going to do that, provide the evidence! So far you're just providing anecdotes or opinions.

I think i've already accepted (‚àÜ) that if there is no access to non-meat food sources, then it's an acceptable reason to eat meat. I disagree a little with the extent to which you suggest there are people without that access, but my view has at least slightly been changed on that, and I haven't denied it anywhere. I'm just continuing the discussion on the wider points that i've mentioned many times in the thread, of morality, environmental impact and efficiency.

I reject the evolution argument entirely, because we have evolved to the point where we are intelligent enough to know the pain and suffering caused to animals by rearing and eating meat, so we should stop it now, at this point in our history. I'm not arguing we should never have eaten meat.

&gt; I think your temperament and style of argument speak clearly about what this is to you.

How, exactly, are you judging that? You can only read my text, not judge my character or sarcasm, or tone of voice, or emotion or anything else. I've felt very calm and level-headed through all my replies to this thread. I'm enjoying it hugely. I like the debate. People have shown me some fascinating arguments...

What you're doing in the paragraph in your latest reply, starting with the quote above, is jumping to a HUGE load of assumption about me. I'd rather you didn't, and we just discussed this intelligently, rather than worrying about my state of mind. Mainly because all of those assumptions are plain wrong. You'll have to take my word on that, because I know myself better than you do from this brief, textual exchange.

&gt; You didn't post here to open your mind, you posted to reinforce your stereotypes and arguments for your chosen position

Absolutely not. What on earth qualifies you to make that claim? I'm genuinely trying to explore my own beliefs and re-evaluate whether I'm right to hold them. It so happens that not much in the thread has changed my view, but I am still certainly very open to it.

&gt;Thus, what I read in this thread is you resorting to talking down, and using fallacious arguments instead of directly refuting what people are putting up. 

Give me some examples of the above, and i'll show you why they are not at all what you think they are.

&gt; Your 'tummy feelings' comments

What does this mean?
 
&gt; your general form of refutation is more about you reassuring yourself of what you already believe than you trying to argue against my and other people's points

I can see why it might seem like that, because I'm not accepting your points immediately and I am actually arguing back, but that's the whole point of the thread... to have the debate... not just for me to accept whatever you say even if I think it's wrong, or lacking in some way. Give me some credit, and assume that I do know what i'm talking about, and perhaps I just have a different view to you, which is certainly backed by logic, thorough consideration, and evidence.

EDIT: rather than arguing about HOW we are arguing, let's get back to the proper debate. Answer my points above if you want to, but suggest some evidence for your claims, rather than anecdotes, and I'll suggest some counter-evidence that I feel disproves it.

Our digestive system is one that evolved for an omnivore and almost no cultures on earth before the modern vegetarian movement were ever vegetarians. We are machines designed to run on more than just fruits and vegetables. So you are inherently being less efficient when you deny your body an essential part of its diet. 

Can you get essential fats from vegetables? Sure you can. Can you get them into your system as efficiently as you can by eating meat? Hell no. Many people have bodies that cannot process vegetables well enough to get enough energy from them.

Saying they just weren't doing vegetarianism <&quot;>right<&quot;> is condescending and ignorant. That's vegetarian propaganda speaking, not rational thought. 

And on the topic of efficiency and sustainability... do you know how inefficient it is eat a vegetarian or vegan diet? To get enough of all your essential nutrients, you need food shipped in from other places on the planet. Take Quinoa for instance. It's all the rage right now in vegetarian circles, but it only grows in places like Bolivia and Chile and its become too expensive for the locals to eat because of the demand from abroad. So your vegetarian diet is causing health problems for people in poor countries and requires more fossil fuels to ship, package, ship again and store until you buy it and pat yourself on the back for being so sustainable and moral. 

Vegetarianism (and even worse, Veganism) is an arrogant modern convenience that comes at the expense of the poor and developing countries. It's like medieval Catholics building gold plated churches in the midst of peasants who were starving. Luxury for the sake of false morality.

The truth is, you are the one whose retoric is fueled by propaganda.  The reason people think we need to drink milk and have meat 1-2 times a day is because big dairy and other CAFOs lobby our congress to influence our regulatory organizations.

<&quot;>you need food shipped in from other places on the planet<&quot;>

Or, you could, you know, eat seasonal local food.  I understand that this is not easily accessible to everyone because of finances or location, but that is not true for most of us.  And everything you had to say about transporting produce around is still true, and on a larger magnitude, for eating meat.  All those veggies our vegetarian overlords have fooled us into eating, those cows and chickens eat that too.  That, too, is transported around.  The difference is, after we transport the food (and the water and the medicine) to the cows, we ship the cows out to a slaughter house.  Then we ship the carcasses to processing companies, then we ship those carcasses.

Environmental arguments:

* Livestock farming constitutes 18% of the contributing factors of climate change (when measured as a CO2 equivalent)

* Livestock provides a 9% share in CO2 emissions, 37% of methane emissions and 65% of nitrous oxide emissions

* Livestock farming takes up 26% of the world's surface: some of which is deforested land. Some report that up to 70% of that land is now degraded as a result.

* Even though about [one in nine](http://water.org/water-crisis/water-facts/water/) do not have access to water, livestock farming consumes 9% of human water use. The livestock themselves, and the methods used to farm it, also contaminate freshwater.

[Source for all the above](ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/a0701e/a0701e07.pdf)

Economic arguments:

* From experience, a vegetarian diet is much cheaper

* Globally, [765 million tonnes of grain are fed to livestock every year](http://web.archive.org/web/20121007180810/http://www.alternet.org/story/134650/the_startling_effects_of_going_vegetarian_for_just_one_day). That's enough to feed every starving person on earth 3 lbs of grain a day. This does not even factor in soy production, which is also fed to livestock. There would be no, or very little, global food shortage if we didn't feed a lot of it to other animals so as to eat them. 

Health arguments:

* Vegetarian diets are healthier. The American Dietetic Association [has stated](http://www.eatright.org/about/content.aspx?id=8357) that people on vegetarian diets have lower: risk of fatal heart disease, cholesterol, blood pressure, hypertension, body mass indexes, cancer rates, instances of chronic disease and levels of Type 2 diabetes. At the same time, vegetarian diets can provide all the needed nutrients, even for athletes.

I make no such assumptions about our supposed ethical superiority; if we are going to treat the rest of the animal kingdom like humanity, then perhaps we should treat humanity like animals.

Now, I'm going to provide a disclaimer here: this is my stance with humanity's relation to other animals.  I think individual people should treat other people *better* than they treat animals.  I think it is sad that I have to say I wish for this.  To say so is to say people don't do it already.

This might seem a bit too tangential here.  I suppose the real root of the issue is my views on vegetarianism are shaped by core beliefs that are basically postulates in my mind.  I think for many people on the other side of the fence, the same principle applies.  

Ultimately though, other people being vegetarian doesn't affect me in a negative way.  I may find the practice of vegetarianism to be pointless or impractical, but even supposing it is, there are lots of other pointless activities people partake in simply because it makes them feel better.

First, not everyone has the resources to be a vegetarian.  It is completely possible to get all the nutrients you need as a vegetarian, but it is also hard and potentially cost-prohibitive.  It is a lifestyle choice that may be the most ethical, all things considered.  But not everyone will be able to afford it.

Second, not all people have the same nutritional requirements.  Certain body types and ethnic backgrounds fair better with certain diets.  It may be possible but not practical for a person like this to live on a non-animal meat diet.  They must find some way to make up for the B12 deficiency.  By categorically saying these people are behaving immorally by perpetuating their own well-being seems a little extreme.

Third, ethical arguments for vegetarianism might not apply to all animals.  I consider myself a utilitarian most days, so much of my research into this stuff was prompted by the philosopher Peter Singer.  In my much larger ethical framework, I feel that the well-being of conscious beings is what one ought to maximize through their actions, and insofar as animals are conscious, they are morally relevant.

The biggest problem that I have with discussions like this are the ways in which people throw around the concepts of ethics and morality, two concepts that are so large that people study them for decades and still feel like they know nothing, concepts so large that libraries of books have been written on them without concise agreement.

So, with that in mind, I will attempt (likely unsuccessfully) to voice my view on the matter without invoking either of those two concepts.

I have no problem eating meat, or with others that do. Nor do I have a problem with those who choose to be vegetarians or vegans (aside from the fact that vegans can sometimes be a bit preachy about how vegan they are). 

I feel that, especially if you buy your edible goods (flora and fauna) from farmers as close to your home as possible, from people who care as much for their flora and fauna as possible (as most farmers do, despite their checkered reputation in the eyes of media outlets), then you're on the right track. I also encourage those of us who DO eat meat to recognize that animals are not all choice cuts. Not all of a cow is Sirloin steak, not all of a chicken is white meat. Eat dark chicken meat, eat the offal from the cow (most of which is surprisingly delicious, if a little <&quot;>icky<&quot;> to think about). If you're going to eat meat then you need to recognize these cuts and partake in them, so nothing is wasted. Glues, soup stocks, leather goods, suet, whatever. It *was* a living creature, *and* you just spent a fuckload of time and energy feeding it, so you might as well use it all, even just to say <&quot;>thanks for the Franks, Frank<&quot;>.

I started typing out some thoughts regarding ethics, but I ran out of comment room, and it rambled. Getting into ethics is ugly business, and I suggest that people stay as far away from it as possible. How do you objectively measure whose suffering is worse than the suffering of another, whether it be human or other species of animal? Is it moral or ethical to even HAVE such a measure?

Firstly, I agree with your environmental arguments, but let's leave them aside for now.  Secondly, animal welfare is important and we don't do enough on it.  Personally, I think every slaughterhouse and farm should be mandated to upload a video of their conditions to the internet every year.  That way people could see what was going on and judge for themselves if the animals were being treated well.  Animal cruelty is in no way acceptable.  

However eating meat doesn't have to be cruel.  Our ancestors have hunted other animals for millions of years and probably wouldn't have survived without doing so.  The native Americans were said to have worshiped nature and treated it with respect.  They were supposed to have used every part of the buffalo, including all the bones, either to eat or use as tools or make into clothes.  

My point is that just because you kill something doesn't mean you don't have to respect it or treat it well while it's alive.  It is traditional in many religions to have prayers that you say before slaughtering an animals or before a meal.  (Islam also has a cruel slaughtering custom but that's beside the point.)

If you're a vegetarian then likely you believe that killing an animal for food is wrong.  Fair enough, but what about the lion?  The lion is a carnivore and hunts and eats gazelles and other animals.  With most moral issues, if we abide by a rule then we think other people should abide by it too.  So I think it's wrong to steal from you and I think it's wrong for you to steal from me too.  

If you are a vegetarian then you either have to come up with a justification as to why lions can do something that you can't do, or you have to argue that lions should be stopped from killing gazelles.  (Which would mean the end of the lion species as they are exclusively a carnivore.)

Please don't think I'm being facetious here.  I know that humans should be held to a higher standard than animals.  We have much more self awareness of our actions and the consequences of them.  We shouldn't act simply as mindless apes.  But we can't ignore our biology either and our place in the food chain and the circle of life.  In some ways, we should act different from animals, obviously, but in other ways, it is ok to acknowledge and not fight against out animal desires.  (Fucking, eating, boxing etc.)

Now to my main argument. 

There are 1.3 billion cows in the world today, 1 billion sheep and - wait for it - 16 billion chickens.  These animals would not exist if the human race hadn't developed the advanced agricultural techniques to feed such an army of animals.  They would also not exist if we did not want to eat them.  Because we want to eat them, they get to live short but hopefully enjoyable lives.  If we didn't want to eat them that wouldn't happen.

I'm going to start transitioning into a more vegetarian diet. The only thing that's holding me back is the cost, and it would at least double my food budget which I can't afford. 

I'd be fine with eating 150g of protein a day; I was wanting to buy bulk spirulina powder. 100g has 57g of protein, It would cost $550 shipped for 250 servings of 100g (25kg) which is pretty good.

What does this mean? Our bodies are able to eat meat and vegetables, but there's no reason to think that because we are able, we should. Just like we are able to kill people, keep slaves, segregate people based on race, start wars etc... able to doesn't mean should.

You say yourself that we have evolved mentally. We now know a huge amount about pain and suffering in animals, so we should know better than to kill them just for the taste of their flesh. 

Animals don't have this ability to understand other animal's pain and suffering, so no one is suggesting that we stop them from killing to eat. That really is natural, and they aren't able to know otherwise.

We grow our own vegetables and have between 10-25 head of cattle at a time. The total number varies depending on the season as they have calves/we sell or butcher cows. We usually butcher one cow every year, year and a half as we run out of meat.  This is supplemented by whatever we happen to hunt on the farm (deer and turkey).

animal welfare/inhumanity: Most cows will live around 10 years. After this point they are elderly and will start having more health issues. The cattle that we don't sell we keep for an average of 7 years. When we kill a cow we shoot it. All of our cattle have access to open fields and shelter during inclement weather. Today I watched 3 calves frolicking in a field while we fed the others. I wouldn't call this inhuman by any means.

Environmental impact: In the area I live I have seen family farms gobbled up by commercial and residential buildings since I was a young child. Farmers usually have a checkerboard pattern of fields and woods. The woods keeps the crops safe from the wind. These woods are almost always knocked down when they are purchased. Our land is in a particularly hilly area so about half of it (possibly a little more) is woods. Raising cattle keeps our farm profitable and that woods undeveloped.

inefficiency: As I mentioned earlier our farm is on very hilly land. This makes it hard to efficiently grow crops on it. Moving large equipment up and down the small roads to the hilltops is difficult and requires a lot of upkeep on the roads. It would also require larger and more expensive equipment to do efficiently. We also have less land to raise crops making it harder to turn a profit. In comparison we can let our cattle graze on the hillsides and we can do most of our work with an old tractor that my grandpa purchased in the 50s. Cows also are able to eat crops that humans can't. We don't need to plant anything in out fields to feed the cows. The grass that grows there naturally is able to feed them. Furthermore once a cow reaches a certain size they can be killed or sold almost instantly (especially when compared to crops). So we have 10+ cows that are ready at anytime if we were to need it.

Quickly addressing hunting. Hunting requires quite a lot of skill to be able to successfully kill an animal. When you do shoot an animal it is over in a matter of seconds and isn't any more painful than when one is killed by a wolf or other predator.

What you're after to 'change your view' are reasons why eating meat is a good idea. Sure they exist (but are generally just health issues that are easily rebutted), but what we carnivores use to justify our diet aren't reasons why we should eat meat, but reasons why we shouldn't *change*

1. There is no real social stigma associated with eating meat - so why bother changing your diet.
2. Your choices when eating out become severely limited - no easy, filling foods like burgers, take away chicken etc. - so why bother limiting your diet
3. You would have to start considering if your diet contains enough protein/vitamins/iron/whatever - why bother making the effort when meat provides a lot of this.
4. Meals become a lot harder - if you're used to foods like e.g. Tacos, Spaghetti Bolognaise, Roasts etc. for dinner you're going to have to learn everything from scratch (I don't know how to cook with Tofu for example. I bet most people don't either). Why bother relearning everything?
5. If you don't like the taste of your meals, you're not going to be motivated *at all* to make them. I know a lot of people who only get through the day by thinking about their next meal and how amazing it's going to be. Suddenly there's no meat. Meals have gone from the most anticipated time of the day to the least. Why would you do that to yourself?

For me it's a little different because I'm a meat eater who doesn't even pretend that his way is better than the vegetarians - I admit there are so many environmental and ethical reasons not to eat meat. But for me, these 'can't be bothered' reasons are still enough to stop me.",,null,null,,0.091,0.785,0.124,0.8814,4,9,9,11,36,15,20,51,68

2.  True.  If you live in a rural area it can be hard to find quality vegetarian/vegan dining.

3.  If you aren't considering what you put in your body, vegetarian or otherwise, you are probably not as healthy as you would be otherwise.  That being said I became a vegetarian as a lazy college kid who wasn't allowed to cook at home when I was a teenager because I always caused a disaster.  It took me about 6 months to transition to easily being a healthy vegetarian.  Saved money, too.

4.Delayed gratification, I guess.  It does require work if you were raised eating meat at every meal as 50% of the calories you are eating, but I was raised in a town with more cows than people.  I figured it out, and I am a dummy.

5.  I feel confidant I eat better (as in, take more enjoyment from my food) than most meat eaters.  My palette has become refined and I actually taste things besides the overwhelming flavors of flesh and blood.

With the other points (besides #1) I have some objections: I never had any problems considering proteins, vitamins or iron (I'm a man though, so anemia is less likely anyways). In my opinion preparing meat is much more difficult than tofu for instance (basically it just has to get warm and it's good to go). But there certainly is some difficulty in composing a meal because there is no clear main part of it (like in a piece of meat with some sides). This is also a reason why restaurants don't have more vegetarian meals, I think, the cooks just aren't taught to deal with meat free meals enough. If they were taught better they would be able to cook things just as delicious as any meal with meat (just look for a vegetarian/vegan restaurant, they serve really good stuff). The problem only exists in the peoples heads, because they are so used to eating meat and don't know the possibilities of vegetarian cuisine.

Right now there seems to be a stigma against vegetarism as many people instantly picture you as the treeloving hippie. And there are certainly very good reasons to eat meat (more diversity in meals / tastes, simpler protein sources, etc.) and because of that I know how unlikely it is that humanity ever will stop eatting meat. I just think that it would serve everyone when more people would realise that you don't need meat for every meal. Even only one meat free day per week would help a lot.

It just seems like you'd have to eat much more of other foods in order to get the amount of protein you need.  

Based on what I've seen in grocery stores in my area, a lot of health and <&quot;>vegetarian<&quot;> foods are ridiculously over-priced by the stores (most notoriously Whole Foods).  Meat has a high protein per calorie ratio, which means even if it is expensive, you don't have to buy much of it to  get what you need from it.  The vegetarian protein sources I googled can be expensive because they cater to a specific group (and plus grocery stores jack prices), and offer less protein per calorie, meaning you're buying more but getting less.  

My main point being:  Meat is a better source of protein and is (generally) more cost effective to suit your bodies needs.  Sure, you can get protein from veggies and such, but it's just not as cost-effective from an economic standpoint. (at least in my opinion)

The point is that there are lots of things we're doing that negatively affect others. Instead of just ignoring them do what you can to minimize it.

I thought at first you were saying that typical joke that red blooded meat eaters will make about what about the suffering of the grapes that you pluck from the vine, shouldn't we only eat grapes that have already fallen.  But then you started to actually defend the position for real which is really laughable but also quite startling and I highly doubt you are going to make me budge an inch on this but I would love to see you try.

I believe that it is quite evident, without any special training or education, to see that this is not a matter of the <&quot;>suffering of 2 beings that have the same senses<&quot;> because 1)plants do not have the necessary hardware to suffer and 2)the <&quot;>senses<&quot;> of plants is NOT AT ALL EVEN CLOSE to the senses of an animal.  Now as for the first thing I will hand wave because I think by definition suffering requires something to be self-aware and the plants like any type of nervous system at all which is required for it.

As for the senses of plants -- are you trying to tell me that a Venus Fly Trap's nyctinastic movement is the same as a cow recoiling from a hot brand?

Lets continue.  Now as I have already said, I have yet to bring up torture at this point, but then you say in response to my confusion <&quot;>I got it from this logic. You said 1) Plants do things when dieing ----Which is very true. 2) Pigs do things when tortured ----what? why do you say tortured? Do you think I am okay with torture? You must, because you think I am comparing carrots to tortured pigs.......<&quot;>

What are you talking about here?  You seem pretty passionate, as I am, but it may be making it really hard to convey what you are trying to say.  As it is now, I don't understand it.  Not as an argument, but as an object of language.  I never said <&quot;>you must think its okay to torture animals<&quot;> or <&quot;>you like torturing animals<&quot;>.  Then you ask to <&quot;>drop torture from our topic<&quot;>, which you are the first to bring up and then have a problem with that it was introduced.  Fine, that makes us both happy I think.

<&quot;>we are all human beings, we are all against torture.<&quot;>  I know this has been using casual language but for the record, not all of us are against torture.  Then, after you decided that we weren't going to talk about torture again, you bring up torture!

<&quot;>How else can you explain how your side (pigs) is tortured but my side (carrots) is not tortured? I must be for torture, or both and or neither would be tortured.<&quot;>

Carrots do not suffer (which is the language I use and I imagine you are confusing with torture) because they are unable to torture.  I claim this because they have no nervous system with which to sense as vertebrate does, and therefore can not experience the pain of suffering.  Maybe you are referring to the psychic pain of being killed, even though there is no physical discomfort for a plant?  I would then say that does not make sense because a plant is not self aware.  I ask that if you would like to continue this point with me that we go on with the assumptions that this is true for plants.  If you would like to argue that either 1)plants do have these capabilities or 2)you can suffer without having these capabilities then I believe we don't have any point in continuing.

<&quot;>You missed my point.<&quot;>

I would say so.  By miles.  Right over my head.

<&quot;>Then, assuming that every time you eat meat you have to eat tortured meat,<&quot;>

I never said that, please don't straw man me here.  I think there is a huge difference than eating meat from a CAFO and eating meat from an animal that lives a happy life and dies without pain and fear.  I still don't think its right, but it is different.

<&quot;>I will put it meanly : Your off base, way off base for assuming I think farrowing crates are okay. So, you can appeal to emotions all you want, but know that it flat out assumes I am okay with farrowing cages.<&quot;>

You have not made it clear to me at all that what I have said means that you are okay with farrowing crates.  Can anyone else out there show me where I am going wrong, or where thenightisdark is going wrong here?

Here is where it gets silly.

<&quot;>1) free range Plants scream in pain, release endorphin. Compare it to 2) Free range pigs scream in pain, release endorphin.<&quot;>

If you don't understand that plants do not release endorphins, than I do not think you should be arguing about something as abstract as a plants capacity for sensing and suffering.

Then you add this edit for <&quot;>clarity<&quot;>.  I don't think that word means what you think it means.

<&quot;>1) you say plants release chemicals 2) then you say tortured pigs are not the same thing

There is no way to get to 2) with out assuming everyone is okay with tortured pigs. This is messed up man, messed up.<&quot;>

Lets rephrase my arguments to what I do actually say, and then go from there.
1) I acknowledge that plants can release chemicals.
2) I state that the sensations of a plant, for lack of a better word, are completely different than that of a pigs -- by quality and by kind.

We don't have to <&quot;>get to<&quot;> 2.  They are both premises, they are not the working parts of the argument.  There is no if-then statement here.

I don't see how my belief that comparing plants and intelligent mammals capacities is ludicrious at all led you to believe I think <&quot;>everyone is okay with tortured pigs<&quot;>

Finally, I feel pretty confidant that <&quot;>screw you<&quot;> probably doesn't have in place in reasonable adult conversation, internet or otherwise.  If we aren't having a reasonable adult conversation, lets just not have one.  Okay?

Second, my opinion is that <&quot;>*a farrowing crate, unable to turn around or stand up for her entire life, screaming out of frustration and boredom.*<&quot;> is torture. If you disagree, then before you read on, tell me why, so we can have the same premise. Sorry if that was a confusion, I thought you would just assume everyone thinks that is torture. I was going from the following definition: 
(en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TortureTorture is the practice or act of deliberately inflicting severe physical pain)

So, got that out of the way. It is confusing sometimes to have more than one discussion at a time, so while it is tempting to try and get on the same page right now, I will continue my argument assuming we both agree so far. 

Moving on, I think that this is not helpful 

**I believe that it is quite evident, without any special training or education, to see that this is not a matter**

I do not think it is quite evident, obviously! :) I actually, honestly think that it is quite evident that plants do feel things. I even support this point with evidence. I think it is not okay to just dismiss my point, my evidence with <&quot;>*I believe that it is quite evident, without any special training or education*<&quot;> If you can not suspend your belief that your point is quite evident, there can be no discussion. 

**Now as for the first thing I will hand wave because I think by definition suffering requires something to be self-aware and the plants like any type of nervous system at all which is required for it.**

Okay, so suffering requires self awareness. That is something I can work with. A nervous system and self awareness are requirements for suffering. Okay, well if that is true would you be opposed to meat that does not come from self aware animals that are lacking nervous systems? I even have an example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_meat Does In Vitro meat suffer? 

**As for the senses of plants -- are you trying to tell me that a Venus Fly Trap's nyctinastic movement is the same as a cow recoiling from a hot brand?**

Yes and no. You are giving my argument the straw man treatment. That said, yes. I will not defend [nyctinastic = hot brand] per say, as those 2 reactions are not similar. However, I would say that [Plants in pain = cow in pain]. Do you see the difference? I do not think [nyctinastic = hot brand], but I do think  [Plants in pain = cow in pain]. 

* Restated

**1) I acknowledge that plants can release chemicals.**

Do you also acknowledge that animals react to stimulus by releasing chemicals?

**2) I state that the sensations of a plant, for lack of a better word, are completely different than that of a pigs -- by quality and by kind.**

refute my evidence to the contrary. Why do you think all those studies are wrong? I need some reasoning, something to go on. WHY!!! Why do you say they are completely different? Where was I wrong? Give me a specific point, something to work with. I provide evidence that is concrete to why I think they are close. For example, when you brand a cow they react by releasing chemicals in to the blood stream. So, I am giving you an example of a cow reacting to pain, and releasing endorphin (a chemical), and taking your premise of plants releasing chemicals, just like a cow does. I do think they are close.

Lastly,

**I think there is a huge difference than eating meat from a CAFO and eating meat from an animal that lives a happy life and dies without pain and fear. I still don't think its right, but it is different.**

I am asking you to forget about CAFO meat for this discussion. I am exclusively talking about eating meat from an animal that lives a happy life and dies without pain and fear, as that is a necessary part of my argument. I can not, nor will defend CAFO. 

So my points are :

1) If you could buy zero-suffering meat, does that mean vegetarians can have a hamburger? If this is a yes, then I have nothing more to say. Meat from zero-suffering source is ideal. It answers the OP's question, what is a valid argument to eat meat? If it is from zero-suffering source!

I got it from this logic. You said
1) Plants do things when dieing ----Which is very true. 
2) Pigs do things when tortured ----what? why do you say tortured? Do you think I am okay with torture? You must, because you think I am comparing carrots to tortured pigs.......

Then you compared that to an unlike event, tortured pigs. Why would you throw this in? Talk about like events, tortured Carrorts and tortured pigs? Or free range pigs, and free range carrorts?

So, I get that you are against torture. Okay, roger. Lets drop torture from our topic, since our topic is not torture. We are all human beings, we are all against torture.

How do you not buy the argument, not even a little?  Is it not evident that supporting two forms of suffering is worse than supporting just one form of that suffering.  And certainly you can be a vegetarian(non-vegan) without wanting to sit on a moral high-horse.  My friend Renee is really trying to be vegan, but grew up on a Dairy Farm in Wisconsin and cheese was a huge part of her diet.  She doesn't try to justify morally her actions.  She just tries to reduce the amount of suffering she contributed to.

Also, I'm just trying to be open mined about the arguments here.  I am aware of these terrible things and it is why I am vegan.  Every vegetarian is not a proselytizing hypocrite, as you seem to be implying.

Survival on a hunter-gather level means nothing to any of us having a discussion a reddit.  We are so far removed from the days where we had to work to stay alive every day all day.  I mean, ffs, there are more people suffering from TOO MUCH FOOD than not enough.

Of course it means we are manufacturing more, and not there is a finite amount.  But, do you know how antibiotics work?  The more they are used, the less effective they are because the next generation of germs that survived the initial treatment are resistant to it.  So there is not a finite amount of penicillin, per se, but as far as the utility of the drug goes, which is all that matters not the volume, there is very much so a finite amount.

I really like where you are going though and I am really looking forward to your reply.

I can see you stating a couple of your reasons. Here are my responses. 

First, What about plant welfare? I am stating that animals AND plants feel pain, so to care for the welfare of animals and plants we need to treat them the same. If you avoid meat, avoid carrots. Ect. Only eat fruits? Or, in my opinion, eat both plants and animals. Source:
http://www.guardian.co.uk/notesandqueries/query/0,,-83446,00.html (I have seen this from more reputable places, but this is a good start.)

environmental impact: I think you mean that growing 50 pounds of grass, then feeding 50 pounds of grass to an animal, then eating 1 pound of the animal causes more damage than growing 50 pounds of grass and eating that directly. I agree with your premise. However, my argument would be that your conclusion is wrong, not your facts. Yes, this causes environmental impact... but it does not have to. For example, http://www.tappi.org/paperu/all_about_paper/earth_answers/GrowTree1.htm Trees. We can absolutely minimize our impact and still have meat, just like we do with trees. Basically, I am arguing that eating meat is a luxury, but a luxury that does not have to ruin the environment. You can be against inefficient meat, environmentally terrible meat, but you can not be against meat in general. You can be for environmentally sensitive meat, but not against all meat in general. 

To me, environmental impact is due to the inefficiency, so you will have to clarify the difference to me. Also, inhumanity is equal to welfare, so if there is a notable difference I need to know what you are trying to say.",,null,null,,0.101,0.825,0.074,-0.8515,4,5,12,10,45,34,17,47,98

Would you consider eating meat if this wasn't an issue?

For example, where I live there is very little suitable arable land - most of it is colder, temperate, steep hillside. As such, the land is used for grazing (sheep mainly) rather than any crops.

Animals raised here aren't cooped up, they are well fed, sheltered and as far as i'm aware, only vaccinated (rather than pumped full of growth hormone). 

For enviromental concerns, there is pretty much no other use for the land. Too hilly for grain farming, too cold / wet for vine/tree based crops. It's just a load of animals keeping the grass short.

Assuming the butchering was humane, would this sort of produce be acceptable? The inefficiencies are effectively dealt with as these animals are not being fed with food that would/should normally be reserved for human consumption.

I admit that this is probably not a typical scenario, but by getting to know your local butcher / producer it is possible be able to source meat that has not been effectively battery farmed.

What you need:  
1 Bar of Soap  
2-6 cups of water  
A cheese grater and a pot  
(optional) thickener  
(optional) scent  

You take the bar of soap you wish to use and grate it up into little flakes.  You put the soap flakes + water into a pot and heat it up.  Then, let it cool down overnight and pour it into a big jug.  Ta-da!  You have a ton of bodywash from your favorite soap.  You'll end up saving money on soap this way AND getting cleaner.  The body wash is more efficient because each bar turns into a massively larger volume.  You also get the other benefits of body wash like easier application and less of a residue.

Optional directions - If the bodywash is the wrong consistency, try adjusting the water ratio.  If it still doesn't feel right you can add in a thickening agent.  Some people use glycerin, others use aloe or xanthan gum.  How much of each depends on the type of soap you use and your personal preference.  You can make small batches until you find the ratio you like.

Optional step - If you want to have a great scent, you can put in scent oils or cologne to customize the smell of your body wash.

How about this: If a corporation wants to donate money to a politician, *as people*, then they can give themselves dividends and whatnot, and it's the same money either way.

If the *corporation* donates it, however, you have to ask *for what reason?* - I mean, by law they're *required* to spend their cash on things which will generate profit for their stockholders, so they're inherently *required* to spend it on what will enable them to make profits, or what will make them *look good* to the public, neither of which should be encouraged.

To begin with, however, I would like to discuss the proposed amendment's complete removal of constitutional protections for corporate entities, because I think there are some protections that most people would agree corporations should have.

Fourth and Fifth Amendment protections of property rights are a good place to start. Should government officials be able to search and seize property of corporations without any restriction? Take property without due process or just compensation? Imagine a cop just walking into McDonald's and helping himself to a burger from the back - this would be totally constitutional now. Imagine also the parks department using eminent domain to take a corporate headquarters and turn it into a park without any sort of compensation for the land taken. This amendment has the power to completely destroy the ability of corporations to function - their property could be seized at any time for any reason without any compensation. Maybe you are OK with that, but it is something you should be aware of.

Now on to the free speech issues. First we need to talk about what is currently protected under the First Amendment and what is not. Under [Buckley v. Valeo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckley_v._Valeo), the First Amendment does not prohibit limitations on contributions to political campaigns by individuals or corporations. Federal law imposes restrictions on campaign contributions by individuals and corporations/PACs as detailed in [this table.](http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/contriblimits.shtml) Independent expenditures, however, are protected under the First Amendment according to [Citizens United](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission).

So, the first thing we notice is that you have framed the issue somewhat incorrectly. This is not about whether corporations are allowed to fund campaigns - that is already illegal, and those laws are constitutional. This is about whether corporations or other associations of people are allowed to spend money engaging in political speech of their own. This is clear when we look at the facts of Citizens United. A corporation produced a video that was critical of Hilary Clinton and wanted to advertise the film and air it on television. That's it. They were not trying to donate money to any campaign or coordinate their speech with any campaign or candidate. The government in Citizens United even argued that a corporation could even be prohibited from publishing a book about a political topic near an election. I hope this makes it clear to you that there are significant free speech implications at play.

Furthermore, I would be concerned that allowing individual independent spending while prohibiting such spending by corporations or associations - which would be the result of this proposal - could actually be counterproductive to the goal of avoiding subversion of the democratic system by a powerful self-interested oligarchy. Incredibly rich individuals, such as Warren Buffet or a Koch brother, would still be able to afford to publish political books, movies, and other forms of speech because they individually have the resources to do so. However, I and many other people may not individually have the money to produce such speech, but would be able to do so if we could pool our money together. Under this proposal, this type of activity would not be protected and could be made illegal. Remember, Citizens United was not about corporate personhood. The majority simply stated <&quot;>If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech.<&quot;>",,null,null,,0.037,0.836,0.127,0.9945,12,2,16,20,89,60,43,69,237

If you were with someone for a long time, then a more physically attractive person came along, would you just discard them because the next person is more physically attractive?

For almost all of us, the answer is no.  The reason why is **relationships are about more than physical attractiveness**.

The world is filled with good looking people, but finding someone who is a good match for you is a lot more complicated.  This means that just because someone finds another person attractive, doesn't mean they believe they are a better partner.

Like you and other commenters have said, it's probably rooted at least somewhat in your own self esteem issues, so it would probably help you significantly to address those with the help of your gf if you feel.comfortable talking to her about it (for instance, how can she help make you feel validated/good about yourself/your body). 

To address your actual statement, I, too get fed up with the frequency of things like saying which celebrity you would fuck or the attitude that if you got a chance with someone famous that would somehow make it okay and not cheating. I've tried to think about a situation where I would do that and I can't come up with any combination of famous/beautiful person and my circumstances if I was still in a relationship, because I do feel it is completely wrong no matter who it is or if it's just one time. 

*But* that is actual physical action/fantasizing. In terms of looking, it has to be okay to do at least to some extent. Do you watch porn or appreciate the attractiveness of girls in movies and tv shows? If so, you understand exactly what is going on in your gf's head - appreciation without necessarily wanting to act on that thought/feeling; the only difference is that when she actually comments on it you get upset. I personally think suppressing things like that and not talking about them is much worse than the occasional comment. Besides, when she tells you she thinks x guy is attractive, it usually implies that you are in some ways similar to whoever she is talking about, which can be viewed as a compliment. Also, if she is telling you, it often means she trusts you and feels comfortable with your relationship such that she can say things like that without having to worry about it negatively affecting your relationship (unless she is a bitch and just tells you because she wants to fuck with you, in which case obviously break up with her. But it sounds like your current gf is definitely not like that).

Finally, a lot of communication has more to do with body language, tone of voice, etc. You can try and ask your gf to talk about things like that in a more matter-of-fact tone of voice (like one would talk about a painting, just less proper) and avoid speaking in a way that sounds like she's really turned on or desires them sexually. 

Obviously like with any relationship issue there's a lot of compromise and give and take at play. I think the biggest thing is to somewhat separate sexual desires/actions from appreciating beauty.

Just because you're in a relationship doesn't mean you suddenly stop finding anything besides your SO aesthetically pleasing. We are built to appreciate beauty, whether it's in the form of a sunset or a brightly colored bird or an attractive person. You're not going to become blind to all that just because you're committed to your SO, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with appreciating the fact that something or someone is pleasing to look at (as long as you don't act on it). 

I've been in a relationship for two years and I still find men besides my boyfriend attractive, but that doesn't translate in any way to thoughts of infidelity. For example, I think Bradley Cooper is insanely sexy, but even if he walked in shirtless right now and asked me to marry him I wouldn't have the slightest urge to say yes. I love my boyfriend, and that love goes way deeper than physical attraction. So I can be completely honest when I say that even if I find another guy attractive my thoughts don't go any further. It doesn't have to have a sexual meaning. I also happen have a huge lady crush on Charlize Theron, I think she's stunning, and I have no problem with my boyfriend sharing that opinion. Honestly, I think it's a little weird if he tells me that he doesn't find ANYONE else attractive (celebrities or real people). 

There is so much beauty in this world! Don't shut it out, and try to learn to be comfortable appreciating it for what it is.

Evolution has given us two drives which are both advantageous, but conflict with each other. We want to fuck anything we see that's attractive and we get jealous when someone we want to have sex with or have been having sex with wants to or does have sex with someone else. It's advantageous to covet attractive people because this promotes procreation. It is also advantageous to be jealous of lovers because this promotes family building. It's about control. If you know your partner will be jealous and angry if you sleep with someone else you have a reason not to. By securing a mating partner you can know if a child is yours (if your a man) and you can keep them around to help raise the kids. So, we have these to drives which are in conflict with each other. What to do? I want to fuck other people, but I don't want to be jealous, and you want to fuck other people but you don't want to be jealous. People have opted for the most part to cater to each other's jealousy rather than catering to their own desire. I personally think this is the wrong move, but to each their own. Also, this is pretty obsolete at this point. Most of the time these days, people don't have sex to procreate. They take measures to ensure that procreation doesn't happen. Only when to people have decided that they like each other enough and want to have kids to they lose the rubber. And even when accidents happen as they often do, people still feel morally obligated to help raise the kids and we have genetic testing to determine a father. Also jealousy is the stupidest most counter-productive emotion there is.

I'd argue that the majority of people who kill themselves do so for this reason (unless you're not counting mental illness as a disease or mental pain as real? because if that's your stance and you're sticking to it, nothing anyone here says is going to matter to you). But from a logical standpoint, both of your exceptions support the fact that you think it's okay to kill yourself if living involves suffering a great deal of anguish on a daily basis. Once we've established that, it seems to me that the onus is on you to explain why the source of that anguish matters if the pain is the same. Sure, you might think that bullying shouldn't cause someone enough pain to kill themselves, but do you really know exactly how much pain they are or are not going through? Did you consider the fact that these sort of outside influences can trigger real mental illnesses (look up the diathesis-stress model of mental illness which is generally accepted by pretty much all psychologists), which brings us back to your exception #2? And how can a third party really quantify the difference in discomfort from, say, a cancer patient and someone with major depressive disorder?  Honestly I'd respect your stance more if you made a blanket statement that you find all suicide cowardly; I wouldn't agree with it either, but at least it would make sense to me.

Do I think that most people who kill themselves are correct to do so? Of course not. In my opinion most people who choose to commit suicide are making the mistake of employing an all too permanent solution to solve what could be a temporary problem with the right treatment and support; to use a popular idiom, they're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. But I'm sure some people are correct in the judgment that their daily pain will never dip below their pain threshold, and in that case, I can't really blame them. It'd liken it to a world in which every NFL player who sustained an injury retired: while it's understandable to miss some games, most of these players would be doing themselves a disservice by ending their careers prematurely; however, some injuries really DO prevent a player from ever playing again, and it's impossible for an outsider to tell which kind is which without access to the medical reports.

As for people glorifying suicides, I'm not saying that it's brave or noble either. What I will say is this: everyone longs for autonomy, and at the most basic level, no matter how shitty or desperate your situation gets and no matter how helpless you are and how far out of control every aspect of your life is, the one thing that's always in your control is your existence. You always have ability to opt out if things get too unbearable and there's no hope that the will turn around (again, unfortunately many people underestimate the chance of recovery).

The first is physical pain, but the more interesting one is this idea of inevitability. If you're getting tortured, your life is obviously out of your hands. If you had the option to say <&quot;>Nope, I'm done with this now.<&quot;> and walk away, then torture wouldn't really be so scary. It's the same way with a severe disease. When people kill themselves to escape a severe disease, it's usually terminal. In the same vein, when people commit suicide from mental illness, it's usually because they can't even imagine what it would be like to be happy again. They feel trapped.

Now imagine for a second that every day you went to school or work, there were people who were determined to make you have a shitty day. Their day wasn't complete until yours was awful. You might say, <&quot;>Why not move?<&quot;> which I suppose is a fair question, but certainly you can imagine some circumstances where your options are limited. For instance maybe you don't have enough money to move, or the move would set your graduation date back by a year which might be unacceptable. You might still feel trapped in the same way.

What makes these problems even more insidious is the way they compound. If you're not super popular, that's probably okay until say, you lose a loved one. Then with no support network you try dealing with that internally. As a result you might alienate the few friends you had, or perform worse at your job or school. With those things gone you lost a major area of your life where you can derive a sense of self-worth from, until it feels like there's no conceivable way that your life will improve. When you reach that level of hopelessness, the idea of suicide becomes a lot more appealing.

So I'm aware that this wasn't super on point answering your question. I too feel that we shouldn't really glorify suicide. I don't think that just because you killed yourself you should be elevated to the status of a martyr, like you intentionally died for a greater cause. (Bullying awareness I suppose?) 

Having said that, the only life you've lived is your own, and even if it looks to you like the person who committed suicide didn't have any <&quot;>real<&quot;> issues, and you would have handled yourself much better in that situation, I think it behooves us to remember that we don't have the intimate details of that person's life, and although their issues may seem insignificant, it would probably be harder to maintain that perspective if you were placed in their shoes.

I have had suicidal thoughts in the past, before I was on effective medication, so let me see if I can adequately explain this...

Sorry for the length, it's a lot to try and explain.

To better understand Depression this is a list of the symptoms...

* Difficulty concentrating, remembering details, and making decisions
* Fatigue and decreased energy
* Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and/or helplessness
* Feelings of hopelessness and/or pessimism
* Insomnia, early-morning wakefulness, or excessive sleeping
* Irritability, restlessness
* Loss of interest in activities or hobbies once pleasurable, including sex
* Overeating or appetite loss
* Persistent aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems
* Persistent sad, anxious, or <&quot;>empty<&quot;> feelings
* Thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts

Now imagine having a combination of all of those symptoms at one time, about 24/7, and never knowing when you'll have a good or a bad day.

On my worst days with untreated Depression I felt like I was dying. Every single thing hurt. My muscles were screaming, my bones ached, even my hair hurt, and the pain had drained my energy. I stayed in bed all day, I wouldn't eat for 2 or 3 days, and I didn't want any bright lights or loud noises around me similar to a bad migraine headache.

If I absolutely *had* to get out of bed, like for school, I felt like I was completely hollow. Like someone had punched through my torso, twisted their hand, and yanked everything out. My legs felt like they weighed a ton and just walking took most of my energy. I wouldn't talk, make eye contact, or hardly even come out of my own world. I was trying my very best to hold all of it together because I was standing on the edge of complete mental breakdown and sanity.

The world looks grey, food has no taste, music sounds like static, reading turns to just scribbles on pages, laughter sounds sharp, being hugged feels like needles in your skin, and you just wish you were anywhere else.

When I would finally sleep I would be out for 12 to 16 hours at a time. When I would finally eat I felt like a starved prisoner trying to inhale food out of desperate hunger. When I would talk with my friends it felt like coming up for air after being underwater too long. Sadly, these <&quot;>good days<&quot;> were very few and far between.

Also, with extreme Depression and Anxiety your Immune System drops and remains low. I would catch minor colds on and off, nasal infections, and mild throat and respiratory infections. 

Aside from the things Depression has done to me, my General Anxiety Disorder shouldn't be forgotten. The thing about Anxiety Disorders is that you are tense and stressed all the time.

These are the general symptoms...

* Fatigue
* Fidgeting
* Headaches
* Nausea
* Numbness in hands and feet 
* Muscle tension and muscle aches
* Difficulty concentrating
* Irritability, agitation, and restlessness

Those are just symptoms that occur all the time, but another major component of Anxiety Disorders are episodes known as [Panic Attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_attack). 

To sum up a Panic Attack, think of it like your body's Fight or Flight reaction. If something your mind perceives as a threat is present you will either fight it or run away, so Fight or Flight. In the past this would be a life saving ability that humans needed to survive, but in the modern world it is less necessary and can short circuit. 

When you have an Anxiety Disorder your brain feels your high levels of anxiety coming from a traumatic memory you're reliving, a stressful situation you're currently in, or just your anxiety levels are too high that day and your brain reacts with Fight or Flight. To your brain it assumes you are in danger and that's why you're anxious or scared, but you aren't in physical danger, you're in emotional danger, and so you have what is known as a Panic Attack.

These are the symptoms of what a Panic Attack entails...

* Heart Palpitations, and/or accelerated heart rate
* Sweating
* Trembling or shaking
* Sensations of shortness of breath or being smothered
* Feeling of choking
* Chest pain or discomfort
* Nausea or abdominal distress
* Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint
* De-realization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself)
* Fear of losing control or going insane
* Sense of impending death
* Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations)
* Chills or hot flashes

I have personally experienced every one of those symptoms and let me tell you it is not fun. You feel like you're having the worst heart attack you can imagine. Your heart is racing, pounding against your chest so hard it feels like your ribs are cracking. You're choking and feel like you're drowning. The lack of air causes my vision to blur, my ears to ring so loud I can't hear anything, and my skin to tingle and go numb. I sweat from the adrenaline being pumped through my body. My lungs feel like they're starting to shrivel in my chest as I still can't breath. My blood feels like fire as it pumps so hard in my veins. I'm hyper aware of every single thing around me and it feels like time has slowed down to a crawl, sadly this means the Panic Attack feels longer than it actually is. 

The really bad Panic Attacks will make me wish someone would just kill me. They feel like an asthma attack, heart-attack, adrenaline/caffeine rush, with a weird sense that the world is tearing away from you and you're almost leaving your body. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy no matter how angry they made me.

So, to summarize so far. Without treatment and medication this is what these things are like... I have Depression that hurts 24/7 and ruined my physical health at 16, Anxiety Disorder that makes social interactions horrifying and causes Panic Attacks 10 to 15 times a day, and all of these things stack together to just feed off of each other. My Depression gets worse when I feel Anxious and worry. My Anxiety gets worse when I'm Depressed, and so on. They feed off each other in a perfect storm of pure hell.

Now, about Suicide and Suicidal thoughts...

The people who commit suicide are often in immense pain, usually mental and emotional, and are in such distress that death is the only way to make all of this just stop and go away. I am thankfully better now with medication, but I still know how all of these things feel. Suicide is a decision that isn't made in a clear mind, these people just feel like they are a burden on people, they have no use here, no one loves them or needs them, everyone hates them, and people would be better off if they were gone.

If you have Depression your brain actually feeds these thoughts to you all the time. <&quot;>You're worthless. You deserve this pain. No one wants you here. They'd be better off without you around. Just go away. Disappear. Think how much happier they'll be without your depressed self bringing them down? Stop being selfish. You don't deserve to live.<&quot;> And now you have the perfect set up for suicide...

No one, as far as I've ever seen, idolizes a person who has committed suicide. Usually the discussion is about, <&quot;>We're sad that they are gone. We wish they would have sought help. This is a real tragedy to have this happen.<&quot;> and so on. The reason the bullies are seen as bad is because these people thoughtlessly and callously hurt someone *knowing* they were having a negative effect on this person.

These people, often teenagers, also often commit suicide because of how young they are. Think of it this way... To these teenagers and children they have *never* experienced anything like this before. They have no context or skills to know how to handle this. They are experiencing these horrible things for the first time and can't see how it will end, because how can they? This is their first experience with it. It'd be like being made at a baby for crying when you leave the room, because they don't yet understand that you're still close by. A baby will eventually learn that you are still there even if they can't see you, but should we really blame the baby?

A teenagers mind can literally not handle Depression as well as an adult's mind. We know this for a fact. Teenagers and young adult brains lack context to know how to handle stress and depression because they lack life experience. The older they get the better everything will be, but how do you explain that to them? They can't comprehend what a *later* will look like. Their mind has no way to fathom that. Suicide seems like the only option because that is the logical point their mind comes to.

It's not that they're <&quot;>letting the bully win<&quot;>. It's more like they truly believe their Depression and their own illness when it says that this won't end and they can't see how it could possibly stop.

People who often commit suicide from mental illness will not be called suicide victims, but some will say their mental illness killed them similar to how a physical illness kills someone.

As a person living with mental illness and an advocate for mental health compassion is vital. You have to understand that these people are sick and in more pain than you can ever imagine. Your mind hurts and it makes your body hurt. These are children, someone's baby, who is hurting and just can't take it anymore and so they take their own life.

Essentially when you go to a restaurant and order a salad, the restaurant may not notice, but you have made a decision eith your money. If you do that more (or more people do it) the average amount of meat the restaurant buys will drop (probably minutely, but over time the price of meat will go up because demand is going down).

The same goes for the supermarket. If you buy meat, then the supermarket will continue to buy meet in the same quantity. If you do not, then while the effect might be small, it's small in the right direction and will push the quantity of meat demanded down!

So while your individual impact is small, it can be small in the right direction or the wrong direction.

Edit: To respond to your vegan/omnivore funding comment, I would like to point out the economics of supply and demand. 

If a restaurant sees less people ordering meat, they will do two things
1. Order less meat from slaughterhouses 
2. Reformulate their menu (typically in a more vegetarian manner that suits their changing clientele). 

By becoming a vegetarian, you are voting with your wallet. The lifetime of revenue you would be funding those slaughterhouses with disappears. Instead, it goes to healthy, ethical alternatives.

The only foodstuff I can think of that would provide a substitute for protein, for example, is mushrooms (which I love) - how would a veggie get enough protein from their diet?

One of the bigger challenges of vegetarianism is avoiding a reliance on carb-heavy or heavily processed foods. I won't try to deny that, since it is something I struggle with at times. However, if you have time to experiment with food and learn to cook a variety of dishes, it is a great choice to try. It certainly breaks the cycle of continuous <&quot;>something-dead-and-something-green<&quot;> cooking that I've seen people fall into.

Let me list a few types of vegetarian proteins (assuming lacto-ovo status and no allergies)

* Dairy

   - Milk

   - Cheese (cottage especially)

   - Yogurt (Greek and Icelandic are best)

* Eggs

* Nuts

 - Peanuts, almonds, cashews, macadamia, etc

* Legumes (technically include peanuts)

 - Soy

    - Edamame &amp; tofu 

 - Beans

 - Lentils

* Certain grains

 - Quinoa

 - Vital wheat gluten / Seitan (like [Field Roast](http://www.fieldroast.com/))

* Mycoprotein (Quorn is an example)

In general I belief that possible negative effects of almost any media can be counteracted by educating people about it. I personally had no bad influence from porn (I am not aware of any at least).

But, here we go:

- Mainstream Porn does not portray a realistic image of what sex usually is. The dynamics between the partners are pretty twisted, often with a very dominant male part. It is also an oversimplification of an act that can (and often is) very subtle and nuanced depending on the individuals engaged. 

- Porn can be accessed by young people in a very impressionable age that, in addition, is often also a phase with incredible peer pressure and a desire to <&quot;>fit in<&quot;>. Own critical thought seems to not always be the first priority.

- Now, given the above points, imagine it like this: Both male and female youth see the depiction of sexual relationship in porn. Combine this with poor education about what it really looks like (as is the case in wide parts of the US at least as far as I know). The concept of relationship in porn is easy to understand. Very defined roles. 

- Males will tend to see their role as dominant, <&quot;>taking what you want<&quot;>, and dismissing female agency in the act (since, all girls want the D anyway, amiright?). Males who would usually not take up this role, do it because they think others expect it of them, including girls. With this they hurt themselves AND their partners who might not want it like this.

- Same concept for girls, just insert stereotypical female roles (subserviance etc.). They will also hurt themselves and others by this unnatural expectation. 

So, what does that result in? A vicious circle. Males act in bad ways because they think girls expect them to while girls accept it because they think its normal. AND VICE VERSA. Girls will even expect the guy to be like this and passively encourage them (even though they themselves might actually not be comfortable with it).

Basically, the vast majority of 'lesbian porn' is not made for lesbians, but for straight men. Lesbians can tell almost immediately - the bored expressions, the (agh, agh, aghhhh) inch-long false nails, the strained chemistry between the actresses, the fact that many of them don't even seem to *enjoy* lesbian action whatsoever - they're all the basic hallmarks of bad porn, but are they really that problematic? In a sense, they present not a real lesbian woman, but a stereotype of what straight men would prefer lesbians to be like. They are invariably presented as hyper-feminine and eager to put on a show, not as actual people. (Yes, hyper-feminine lesbians that like to put on shows exist, but they are not the expected norm.) The issue here is that porn rarely presents anything other than that norm, as it isn't a representation of real people, but a fetishisation.

And in many of the cases (from what I have personally seen to date), the lesbian action is usually interrupted at some point or another so some random dude can pop in and have his way with said ladies. They don't even hesitate in letting him participate, and it generally is not questioned whatsoever.

But what's the problem with that? Bisexual women exist after all, so what's the issue?

It's more how the women in these scenes are presented. And by that, I mean that they are not described as 'sexy bi girls' but 'lesbians'. They are found in the 'lesbian' sections of whatever website you're using, and, in some particular videos, the emphasis is placed upon how much of a lesbian they are... Until the perfect dick comes along, of course, in which case they'll drop everything and more or less worship it. This plays to the frustration/jealousy of an average Joe who cannot possibly conceive of a beautiful woman who does not want his dick and presents an appealing alternative: not only was this gorgeous porn star totally gay, but he, through the magical power of his cock, 'turned' her.

So, here are the ways that these two points that I've made have affected me, as an average lesbian, negatively. I am not speaking for anyone but myself, and I know that experiences may differ.

When I go to a club, or on a night out with my girlfriend or some of my other lesbian friends, I can invariably expect harassment from straight dudes. My personal record of 'random men I've never met asking for threesomes with gf and I in one night' is five. And by the way, when you say no, they argue with you, get belligerent and, in one of my friend's cases, they pulled down her girlfriend's skirt and had their friends waiting to immediately take photos after they refused to meet some stranger in the loo for a quickie. To punish them for saying no. If I tell someone that is hitting on me in a club that I'm gay, they attempt to coerce me into 'just trying it out'. I've had dudes move three inches away from my girlfriend and I while we were kissing and just stare at us blatantly. When we pulled away to look at him and ask him what the fuck he was doing, he told us to not mind him and carry on. The more girly we dress, the more sexually harassed we are.

**TL;DR**: These experiences are not solely the result of fetishisation of lesbians in porn- it would be ridiculous to claim that. But by reinforcing the concept that lesbians can be 'turned' in the first place, and that lesbians only have relationships so dudes can enjoy the show, it makes us seem less like real people and more like constructs for dudes to whack off to- fantasy objects that don't have a purpose other than titillating others. Which, in my opinion, encourages people to act like unrepentant dickheads when they actually encounter lesbians in the wild.

- straight women have to put up with *pretty much* the same bullshit from the douchebag segment of man-kind as you do, if not more of it (which you may or may not realize).  It's less that you're being singled out for conversion and more some men are tools.  You mention it happens more as you dress more conventionally attractively?  Yeah, that happens to straight women too.  (It goes without saying that it *shouldn't* happen to anyone.)
- while I can totally understand the frustration of being misrepresented, there are worse fates as a minority group than to have a lot of the mainstream group think, basically, that you're exotic and hot.

I don't personally feel that porn is the most detrimental thing to lesbians in the grand scheme of things- I was mostly trying to explain in a straightforward way how I might have been affected as an individual by the fetishisation of lesbians in porn. But, I suppose the difference between your point about straight porn not being representative and mine about representation of lesbians in porn is that straight men who are not virgins are typically capable of recognising the disconnect between the fantasy and the actual act. After all, they've experienced it, and those that haven't probably will at some point in their lives. Difference being that they have the chance to figure out the reality of heterosexual sex, but they are significantly less likely to meet a lesbian couple IRL that might dispel their previous beliefs/fetishisation. 

Your point about straight women experiencing similar things on nights out is absolutely valid, of course. However, better/worse is sort of subjective, so I tried not to stray into that territory. What you said about dressing conventionally is true, but what I did not mention (because my post was getting quite long and it was off topic of porn/fetishisation) was that dressing 'butch' is also a risk, as it can draw negative, often verbally abusive attention to said individual. Especially if your city doesn't have a gay night or a gay bar to go to instead.

I didn't want to go into great detail about other things that I have personally experienced as a lesbian in society, as it didn't specifically pertain to the subject of 'how fetishisation in porn is damaging x group'. Basically, I didn't mean for my post to explain the entirety of my particular minority's plight, only an aspect of it. There are many more issues that I did not go into, such as corrective rape, queer bashing, gay marriage or the lack thereof, bans from adoption, etc, because I don't think that these issues stem from pornography, but other elements of society.

18icsv,27,c8gsqew,c8fp67j,1.361131852E9,Lust_the_Eunuch,,3,"I'll give this one a shot. 

Many pornographic images or films with specific themes of sexuality or race are created with a target audience of heterosexual white men. Because of this, and because of the fact that they are designed as erotic material, the accuracy of the portrayal of different groups is an almost non-existant secondary to what portrayal of them would be seen as erotic to a heterosexual white man. 

This leads to several uncomfortable stereotypes: 
1. Lesbians are all stereotypically feminine and secretly want a man, or are only having sex with each other to please men. They prefer penetration to other forms of sex. The sexuality as a whole is a fetish, not a legitimate romantic and sexual preference. 
2. Black men are powerful and aggressive, sometimes violent, and always dominate. They steal white women. White women are submissive. The only reason a white woman would be with a black man is because of his sexual dominance and his penis size. 
3. Black women are exotic, sexually obsessed beings. They are always adventurous in bed. White men are used to only white women, who of course, are submissive and unadventurous. 

(Also, when interracial or sexuality specific pornographic films are combined with rape or domination kinks and fetishes, it furthers harmful stereotypes of races or sexualities being dangerous.)

With this said, adults for the most part know the difference between people and people acting in pornography. Of course no one acts the way anyone does in porn. Of course no one expects anyone to behave that way. 

But with impressionable younger people (who are white and heterosexual and male) who haven't been exposed to different sexualities and different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds, the pornography might  be their only knowledge on the subject of black people and lesbians. They might draw on that, even subconsciously, when they do meet new people in real life through assuming a black man is more dangerous to women than a white man, or assuming black women are more promiscuous, or being frustrated at lesbians for having no interest in them as men. 

Minorities have enough trouble with racists and homophobic people and stereotypes. The porn that plays on all of these elements doesn't help them.",,null,null,,0.126,0.824,0.05,-0.9829,1,3,6,6,52,16,13,66,95

For instance, let's assume that adding a warning label to a product would cost $100k per year, and that it would prevent one person per year from being killed by the product. Further assume that the average person killed would have earned $500k over the remainder of his or her life. In the absence of any requirement to include a warning label, the manufacturer does not have to bear the cost of the person injured, so it will of course not add the label. This is because adding the label would cost $100k with no benefit to the manufacturer.

So, the manufacturer is $100k richer but the estate of the person who dies is $500k poorer. This is a net loss of $400k to the society.

I mean, at the very least, you can credit them with having made you.
That's pretty special! I don't mean physically, either. They will surely have passed on a lot of their values to you. You will naturally have a lot of opinions in common. It probably feels differently because once you know someone well, you tend to take the similarities for granted. All those habits and opinions you share are easy to deal with, but the differences can be jarring. I think many people never realise how much focus we put on our differences.
(Quick note: I don't think that this is a bad thing. They make relationships interesting in general. Have you ever talked to someone who agrees with you about everything? They're great to hang out with, but terrible friends)
So to recap, you have a lot more in common than you realise.

For a more <&quot;>selfish<&quot;> argument, your parents will probably love you (mostly) unconditionally. There are a lot of stories out there about parents who kick their kids out because drugs/pregnancy/whatever, but these represent a small minority of cases. Most parents love their children and most of them try to respect their life choices.

I'll get back to my first point and go to bed, because it's already way too late. If you think your parents are average, you probably need to change your relationship with them. I've seen this in a few of my friends. When they reached their twenties, they started to grow up properly. They would leave home, get a degree or a job (sometimes both), and become <&quot;>real<&quot;> adults. But whenever they interacted with their parents, they reverted to teenagers. That's because they hadn't been able to change their relationship with their parents. They were in the same situation as you are: parents cannot add anything to your life if they aren't communicating in a way that's relevant to your life. Or, even worse, if they aren't communicating things that are relevant to your life.
It was straightforward for me to change with my parents because they both prefer adults to children. Looking back, it's almost as if they were waiting for us to grow up so that we would become interesting (in fact, that's exactly how my mother put it). Maybe you need to interact with your parents differently to discover parts of their personalities that make them not-average.
Every person I have ever met has been amazing in some way. Maybe I'm naive, but I think that it's true for everyone. Your parents are people who already care for you, and I think that if you manage to open up a dialogue with them, you will almost certainly discover that you can become great friends.",,null,null,,0.039,0.816,0.145,0.995,11,12,14,26,65,60,53,100,125

After you're raped, your world shatters. Nothing about the incident makes sense, and all you can do is blame yourself and tell yourself that if you had done something different it wouldn't have happened. You don't have any power over your attacker's actions, so it almost gives you some control if you take the blame into your own hands, like it will make it easier to comprehend somehow if the fault lies with you. 

And let me tell you, the FIRST thing that comes to your mind is that you should have been wearing different clothing. I was walking home from work and it was 80 degrees that evening, so I was wearing shorts and a tank top. But after the incident I convinced myself that I should have worn jeans and a sweatshirt and nothing would have happened. That idea stuck in my head, maybe because it was the most tangible explanation for why I went through what I did and I didn't have the emotional strength to think about it in any other way. Clothing was something solid I could hold on to as an answer to the never ending <&quot;>why,<&quot;> and it was easy to make myself truly believe that I was at fault because of my outfit. 

So every time someone else would ask what I was wearing, just the act of asking that question reinforced my self blame. It didn't matter if they also said <&quot;>it doesn't matter he still shouldn't have done it,<&quot;> the idea was lodged in my brain and kept building on itself. I can't describe the dark place you go after something like this. I used my clothing to excuse his actions, even though I know now that there's absolutely no excuse for what he did. Now, I wasn't dressed like a slut, but even so the question of what I was wearing was very harmful to my emotional health. In those days and weeks and months after being raped, you need 100% positive support in order to start to piece yourself back together, and questions that shift any of the blame towards you can be hugely detrimental in your recovery.

Because honestly, at the end of the day it's none of your damn business what I was wearing. I did not deserve what happened to me in any way shape or form.

It's not about shifting blame, it's just recognizing that attracting attention means both good and bad attention, and it's smart to pick your spots.  There is absolutely nobody in the United States that would argue for a rapist to get off or even get a reduced sentence because his/her victim was scantily dressed or even bare assed naked.

Think about it. If women start covering themselves up all the time to prevent rape, soon enough that turtle neck and trackies combo is going to seem provocative to someone out there, and that person might use it as a way to justify raping the woman wearing it.

I am arguing that rape can't be prevented by dressing modestly.

And the point I'm making about the people using how (provocatively or not) the victim was dressed as evidence is that it reflects a dark side of our culture, where how a rape victim is dressed is perceived as relevant, showing skin and sex appeal are considered risk factors, and dressing modestly will prevent rape, even though there is a lot of research out there stating that rape isn't about the sex, it's about the power:

Rape is less about sex than it is about power. Keep that in mind.

For me, it boils down to the fact that my body is *mine* and **NO ONE** has the right to infer one thing or another about me based on what I'm wearing, ESPECIALLY that they have the right to my body. Anecdotal example: I used to see Rocky Horror shadow cast shows before I was sexually active. I'd dress up in a corset and fishnets and tease my hair and wear garish makeup and look as trashy as possible. It was about going out with friends and being offensive and ridiculous. After the shows we would usually go to Denny's. Imagine a group of ~10 young people in lingerie and generally absurd stylings walking into a public restaurant at 2am. Of course we got odd looks, but we were (generally) well-behaved and tipped well. Would you expect someone who feels comfortable walking around wearing lingerie in public (albeit at an hour when very few people are out and about) to be a virgin or a whore? Why? Would it be okay to say they were <&quot;>asking for it<&quot;> if they got raped?

Rather than teaching people to look out for rapists and do what you can to prevent getting assaulted, much more emphasis should be put on teaching others *not to rape.* No one should fear for their safety because they feel like wearing a short skirt. I should have the right to wear what I want without worrying about someone else decided they are welcome to my body.

Whether or not how someone dresses is vulgar or not and whether or not that vulgarity/immodesty is okay is another matter, in my opinion. I don't necessarily want to see tons of women with shirts cut down to here and skirts cut up to there, but if they feel like dressing that way, they should absolutely still have the right to do so and not fear for their safety.",,null,null,,0.136,0.749,0.116,-0.9257,4,3,6,22,55,38,36,74,89

If you just mean free market in the sense that it currently exists in, say, America, then China was incredibly close, with the main difference being more restrictions on international trade and none on safety, with very little, much less than in America, regulation on internal trade.

I'm arguing it had a semi-free market. Not a true free market in any sense, but something relatively close when concerning interior trade. It definitely wasn't anything even remotely close to a free market regarding imports/exports. However, one should remember that Imperial China was as economically powerful as the rest of the world combined, and thus interior trade wasn't insignificant. But, heavy regulations are something relatively new. Of course regulations existed in the past, and they were actually very heavy in Imperial china when relating to imports/exports, but regulation of the market to promote/refute monopolies is something new (when put into perspective against 4000 years of semi-capitalism). In some ways China resembled a free market, but it most certainly wasn't one. The reason I referred to it in the first place is that it is one of my main areas of expertise. China wasn't actually the best example of Ancient free market capitalism, for that one should probably turn to the Akkadian Empire.

Most of the world agrees with me actually. I wrote my last comment when slightly delirious from fatigue, so it's no surprise that it's rather unclear in retrospective. What I should have said is that while Imperial China certainly had regulations, these regulations weren't concerned with and didn't effect the formation or sustainment of monopolies in a meaningful way. The throne would often regulate imports or exports to stop China from either becoming dependant of foreign powers, or to prevent a dilution in the value of Chinese goods. However, none of these restrictions were placed on interior, in other words inter-provincial, trade. At the time, the Chinese economy was so massive that the entire rest of the world combined was roughly on par with China, and thus interior trade was incredibly significant, and it was much closer to unregulated.

But, that said, a two second search of cited wikipedia information shows some of the other oft-forgotten effects of Capitalism and the Industrial Revolution:

1. The application of steam power to the industrial processes of printing supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing, which reinforced rising literacy and demands for mass political participation.

2. During the Industrial Revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730‚Äì1749 to 31.8% in 1810‚Äì1829.
3. Consumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles such as cast iron cooking utensils and stoves for cooking and space heating.

4. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, advances in agriculture or technology soon led to an increase in population, which again strained food and other resources, limiting increases in per capita income. This condition is called the Malthusian trap, and it was finally overcome by industrialization.

5. Living conditions during the Industrial Revolution varied from the splendour of the homes of the owners to the squalor of the lives of the workers. Engels, whose book In The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 exposed the horrors of the working class. However, in the 1892 edition of the same book, he noted <&quot;>that most of the conditions he wrote about in 1844 had been greatly improved.<&quot;>

6. In terms of social structure, the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a middle class of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry. Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines. As late as the year 1900, most industrial workers in the United States still worked a 10-hour day (12 hours in the steel industry), yet earned from 20 to 40 percent less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life. However, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place. Pre-industrial society was very static and often cruel‚Äîchild labour, dirty living conditions, and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.

There's a lot more to read about, but the book <&quot;>The Myth of the Robber Barons<&quot;> will give an alternative perspective to the prototypical public-school narrative of the Industrial Revolution as a horrible time for the poor and working class - to the benefit of the rich.",,null,null,,0.078,0.865,0.058,-0.8873,2,1,3,11,83,74,11,48,130

Capitalism is characterized by alienated production. By reducing workers to sell themselves for sustenance capitalism alienates workers from their own productive lives and their higher needs of belonging, esteem, and self-actualization.

The system of alienation is founded on absentee ownership. Thanks to the world intellectual property organization (WIPO) capitalists have ownership of intellectual property even from thousands of miles away. Modern consumers are alienated from their own products because the design of their products are privately owned by capitalists even though the owners may be far away.

The system of absentee ownership also allows for the capitalists to privately own instruments of labor even when they aren't using them themselves. Workers are reduced to using privately owned owned instruments of labor alienating themselves from production in the process. Furthermore, workers have to compete with one another to sell their labour power on the market alienating workers from one another.

In total capitalism is characterized by four types of alienation (1) alienation from products (absentee ownership of product designs), (2) alienation from production (absentee ownership of instruments of labor), (3) alienation from ones own life, and (4) alienation from ones fellow workers.

You said of capitalism that <&quot;>It values/rewards hard work, talent, ingenuity, etc. It provides for open competition. It presents a truly equal playing field for all.<&quot;> Assuming that that this statement is accurate and these things are good they are not at all dependent upon capitalism. 

Mutualism has all these features including extra rewards for those are hard working or talented. The only thing that effectively distinguishes mutualism from capitalism is that there is no longer any alienation. In place of alienated production, mutualism is maintained by self employed artisans and farmers, small producers cooperatives, and other forms of associations of free producers. 

I think that wikis are a great example of what is possible without alienation. In wikis there is no user/producer distinction because wikis are produced by the users themselves.

*Money makes you more efficient at competition.*

Now, this is an obvious thing.  The problem is this causes an inevitable shift towards consolidation.  One company starts to compete slightly better than others and gets an advantage, then they leverage that advantage and can compete *better still*.  This forms a feedback loop giving them more and more money and more and more competitive advantage.  Eventually they get rich and efficient enough that no company can compete with them in their field, and all the other companies are killed off.  This is called a monopoly.

A monopoly is the inevitable result of capitalism.  Monopolies will always form in a laissez-faire capitalist system, much like water will always flow downhill.  Once a monopoly is formed, they tend to just extract rent.  In other words, they give a shitty service but they're so big they can prevent others from competing while still grabbing up huge bags of money.

As for competing systems, the easiest answer is a mixed economy.  It's capitalism with strict government controls, reigning in on monopolies, and government enforcement of fair markets.  It's part free market, part central planning.  The only question is how much do you mix?  80-20 Capitalism-Communism, 50-50, or 20-80?

Yet a *persistent and rent-seeking* monopoly is the inevitable result of *government regulation*. 

&gt;Monopolies will always form in a laissez-faire capitalist system, much like water will always flow downhill.

However, when a monopoly forms in a free market system, the monopoly must continue to be the best possible service or product provider, because without government's regulatory protections, *if the monopoly are not the best provider, a competitor will emerge!* You see, a monopoly is not *inherently* a bad thing, if the monopoly *does* provide the best output at the best price. This is only a problem in two circumstances: The monopoly does *not* provide the best output at the best price, and it is not trivial for a new competitor to emerge. Neither of these are concerns in a free market, but are massive concerns in a regulated market that creates obstacles to competition. 

&gt;Once a monopoly is formed, they tend to just extract rent. In other words, they give a shitty service but they're so big they can prevent others from competing while still grabbing up huge bags of money.

*Only when a government exists to protect the monopoly from competition.* In a free market monopoly, this rent-seeking would be extinguished quickly by the inevitable emergence of competition that *is not* rent seeking.

Unless you buy into some sort of objective valuation principle (which I find nonsensical and have never seen convincingly defended) then it's hard to argue that a voluntary transfer is in and of itself <&quot;>screwing<&quot;> over one party, since both by definition benefit. Now, there might be a case for arguing in prior wrongdoing (such as using government power to strange competition or gain some advantage, as Standard Oil most certainly did) or in some other way using force or fraud to gain property with which to exercise increased bargaining power than would otherwise have happened, but both of these are distinctly not artifacts of the free market. Do they occur in otherwise free markets? Sure, people suck. But the fact remains that our system of government currently (and most certainly did in the 19th century) do a hell of a lot to make sure that certain people were favored, and there's a lot of theory on how a free market would counter these sorts of things.

Ultimately, however, I find your general point very unconvincing. The key benefit of Standard Oil was that it standardized oil, making things cheaper, safer, and much more convenient for virtually the entire population (and, quite likely, saving some types of whales from extinction in the process, but that's just a random aside). How much of a market-share would that have required, exactly? I'd assert that you can't know, and that there's no way you could know a whole host of issues.

To get started, here is a short article on the history of the cartel.  [De Beers and Beyond: The History of the International Diamond Cartel](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~lcabral/teaching/debeers3.pdf) From the article:

<&quot;>Cecil Rhodes was one of the Ô¨Årst businessmen to rent out pumping equipment and soon realized that he had tapped a vast market potential. He reinvested the initial proceeds from equipment rental in acquiring claims. By 1880, he held a large enough share of diamond claims to justify a separate company purely concerned with managing the mines: thus DeBeers Mining Company was created. By 1887, the company was the sole owner of South African diamond mines.<&quot;>

This passage might lead a proponent of the sustained coercive free market monopoly theory to say <&quot;>Ahah, this is exactly what I am talking about.<&quot;>  A business man is the first in the market, becomes successful, and before long he owns everything.<&quot;>  Not so fast.

As Raymond Dumett wrote in Mining Tycoons in the Age of Empire, 1870-1945:  
<&quot;>As soon as he became a politician, Rhodes served on a Select Committee of the House of Assembly, which overhauled the diamond trade laws, and successfully recommended new acts in 1882 and 1883 which gave mine owners powers to control illicit trading and special protection for private mine areas against casual prospecting rights which De Beers consolidated inherited and enforced in all areas of operation subsequently.<&quot;>

Rhodes began his political career in South Africa in 1880, his acts were introduced in 1882 and 1883, and by 1887 he owned all of the diamond mines in South Africa.  To further demonstrate the type of political power Rhodes was able to garner and the adverse effects of his use of this political power, cite his Wikipedia entry:  

<&quot;>In 1890, Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony and implemented laws that would benefit mine and industry owners. He introduced the Glen Grey Act to push black people from their lands and make way for industrial development. The growing number of enfranchised Black people in the Cape led him to raise the franchise requirements in 1892 to counter this preponderance, with drastic effects on the traditional Cape Qualified Franchise (the system of non-racial franchise that was traditionally adhered to by the Cape Colony, whereby qualifications for suffrage were applied equally to all voters, regardless of race.)<&quot;>  

Ernest Oppenheimer, his main competitor, by 1919 had won several mine concessions from the German empire. Oppenheimer worked with the South African government by means of the Diamond Control Act of 1925, the Precious Stones Act of 1927, and the national Diamond Producer's Association to acquire De Beers, cartelize South African diamond production, and severely restrict both entry into the industry and the supply of diamonds.

Murray Rothbard also wrote on this topic in Making Economic Sense:  
  
<&quot;>The answer is simple: the market has not been really free. In particular, in South Africa, the major center of world diamond production, there has been no free enterprise in diamond mining. The government long ago nationalized all diamond mines, and anyone who finds a diamond mine on his property discovers that the mine immediately becomes government property. The South African government then licenses mine operators who lease the mines from the government and, it so happened, that lo and behold!, the only licensees turned out to be either DeBeers itself or other firms who were willing to play ball with the DeBeers cartel. In short: the international diamond cartel was only maintained and has only prospered because it was enforced by the South African government.

And enforced to the hilt: for there were severe sanctions against any independent miners and merchants who tried to produce <&quot;>illegal<&quot;> diamonds, even though they were mined on what used to be private property. The South African government has invested considerable resources in vessels that constantly patrol the coast, firing on and apprehending the supposedly pernicious diamond <&quot;>smugglers.<&quot;>

Back in the pre-Gorbachev era, it was announced that Russia had discovered considerable diamond resources. For a while, there was fear among DeBeers and the cartelists that the Russians would break the international diamond cartel by selling in the open market abroad. Never fear, however. The Soviet government, as a professional monopolist itself, was happy to cut a deal with DeBeers and receive an allocation of their own quota of diamonds to sell to the CSO.<&quot;>

&gt;It presents a truly equal playing field for all

I take issue with these two. I'll start with the second statement. Do you really think that a kid born in a ghetto has an equal starting place with a kid born to millionaires? Sure, you can argue that with talent and hard work, a kid born with a disadvantage can still succeed, and that a kid born with an advantage can still fail if he screws up enough. But if you look at the averages, it's exceedingly clear who's more likely to succeed, and who's more likely to fail. Unless you'd like to argue that kids born to poor parents are inherently inferior to kids born to wealth parents, then it's clear capitalism provides anything but a level playing field.

As for the first statement, studies have shown repeatedly that money is actually a rather poor incentive for creativity. When a job requires any kind of higher thinking, independence is actually a much greater motivation than monetary reward, and that's something capitalism is frankly terrible at. Take a look at [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc) if you want to learn more.

As for hard work, why is that something we should even value? Sure, 200 years ago, not working hard meant you would starve to death, but that's not the case anymore. We could easily keep society running and maintain our standard of living with a fraction of the effort we put in now, so why is more work something to be encouraged? In fact, we're actually running *out* of work for people to do, which is why you get the paradox of some people working 60 plus hours a week and still not making ends meet, and some people not being able to find a job at all.

18ssrl,106,c8hpilw,c8hokqx,1.361257652E9,DaystarEld,8,7,"Okay, so keeping in mind that I absolutely agree with you that capitalism is the best economic system for promoting progress and wealth:

1) The free market is an utter failure at ensuring health and safety.  This isn't just opinion: this is historical fact backed by mountains of evidence.

See, the myth that the free market ensures health and safety is a relatively recent one: just the last few decades or so.  It's based on the premise that citizens will patron those companies and businesses that don't harm them.  Or, flipped the other way around, <&quot;>Killing your customers is a terrible business plan.<&quot;>

Except if that were true, tobacco and alcohol wouldn't be multimillion dollar industries.  The reason this premise is flawed is that it assumes two things: an informed citizenry with full access to all information, and clear causality between product and result.

Let's take those in reverse order: there is very rarely a clear causality between product and result.  Meaning, if a company has unsafe business practices that result in, say, food poisoning, reality is not as clear as we'd like it to be.  You don't just buy a hotdog, get violently ill, and say <&quot;>I'm never buying Oscar Meyer Weiners again!<&quot;>

Because how do you know what made you sick? Was it the hotdog? Was it the bun? Was it the relish?  What if it was the vendor that sold it to you?  How would you know? How COULD you know?

This is why government regulation is necessary.  What libertarians and conservatives often forget is that regulations didn't pop up out of the ether for the sole purpose of ruining civilization: they came as a result of actual problems with the free market.  Our history is full of lessons that those ignorant of it are quick to ignore. Read *The Jungle,* by Upton Sinclair.  Food poisoning was an everyday occurrence before the FDA was formed and regulated safety standards for food companies. When's the last time someone you know died of food poisoning?

The same goes for other things, like tobacco.  Do you know how long it took for citizens to realize how deadly smoking that shit is?  Do you know how many **millions** of dollars the tobacco corporations spent hiding the truth of it, and deliberately misleading their customers?  It took government intervention to step in and say <&quot;>Before you sell a product, we need to know what the effects of that product are.<&quot;>

<&quot;>But wait,<&quot;> you may be saying now.  <&quot;>All that happened years ago! Before the internet!  Why, we don't need government to hold our hands anymore! The intelligent citizen of today should properly do their own research!<&quot;>

Which leads me to the other point: <&quot;>an informed citizenry with full access to all information<&quot;> is impossible without unified public effort, aka, governmental agencies.  All information that you can find on the effects of everything from tobacco to lead paint to asbestos are the result of publicly funded research.  Corporations have absolutely no incentive to be honest about their research if it paints them in a negative light.  As long as they can get away with hiding a negative truth, they will.  This has been proven time and again. And they have far, far more money and resources than citizens do.

Now let's look at pollution: another favorite of the <&quot;>free market solves everything<&quot;> myth.  By this happy ignorance of history, politicians like Ron Paul argue that without federal intervention and regulation, companies wouldn't pollute on other people's land because there would be legal consequences, and if they want to pollute their own land, why shouldn't they? It's their land!

Except this isn't just ignorance of history: this is ignorance of ecology. Nature doesn't care <&quot;>whose land<&quot;> it is.  Pollution dumped in a privately owned lake does not only affect that lake: it affects all the animals that use that lake for water, all the birds that use those insects and fish for food.  The effects on the local ecosystem for strip-mining or dumping hazardous chemicals can be utterly devastating, and do not stop at the imaginary lines we humans have drawn to dictate <&quot;>property.<&quot;>  Water seeps into aquifers shared by entire cities for drinking, flow through rivers that others fish in.

Furthermore, there is once again a problem of no direct cause-effect.  It takes years, sometimes decades, of intensive research to trace a problem in the environment back to its cause... and usually by then it's too late to reverse the damage.  What lawsuit is sufficient for a town of parents whose children have abnormally high levels of leukemia due to pollution from a nearby dye plant?  What CEO would be deterred from bad press that may not occur for years after they've retired and sold the business?

And again, **all of these things have happened before.** The EPA is a necessary force in stopping these things from happening in the first place: simply punishing them after they occur is not enough.

Does all of this mean that regulations can't be unfair or outdated? Of course not!  There are many laws that are poorly made, do more harm than good, or are simply not needed anymore.  But that's no more an argument to do away with ALL of them than cutting your head off because you have a headache is.

2) It's late, so I'll make this one quick: The Free Market doesn't reward everyone equally for effort put in.  It also doesn't fairly balance opportunity. We as a society do better when more people are given as many opportunities for success as possible: and that means ensuring that those with the least among us are able to survive long enough to be given a chance to prosper and grow.

Right now, at this very second, the next Einstein may be starving in the streets of LA.  She was born into a family with no money, to parents who were crackheads and gangbangers.  She had nothing remotely close to a formal education, and turned to doing whatever she could to get by.

This is a person who has fallen through the cracks in our society, and the free market has no need of her, cares nothing for her talents or her latent ingenuity.  It only cares about what you have, and what others need. It is a mindless machine of supply and demand, excellent for efficiency, but terrible at foresight.

But WE ARE NOT.  We can recognize that without programs to help those without opportunity, we weaken our entire society by ensuring their lack of success, by codifying poverty.  We deprive it of the next generation's potential by limiting its resources to only those lucky enough to be born into the middle or upper classes.

JK Rowling wrote Harry Potter while waiting tables to pay rent and using the UK equivalent of foodstamps to buy food.  Steven Hawking is only globally known as the smartest man of his generation because our society recognized that shit happens, life isn't fair, but by all the angels and the power of Greyskull, **we can change that.** We can give some money, a few cents from each of us, a few dollars from those with many more, to ensure that those struck by serious debilitation don't end up in the street or dead, their families impoverished, their entire lives and futures robbed by the mad whims of fate.

And despite all the detractors, despite all the hysterical cries of <&quot;>moochers<&quot;> or <&quot;>leeches,<&quot;> despite the reality that there are those few who take advantage of the system, who use it as an excuse to be lazy or fake illnesses, we are stronger as a whole because of it.

And any individual who thinks it's unfair that some meager portion of their income is going to help those in need, but insists that others would/should be able to make that charitable donation themselves: tough shit.  Giving to charities are tax-deductible for a reason, and feel free to give more if you want to, but be aware that you live in a society, and society exists to better the whole: not enrich the few. If you want to <&quot;>Go Galt,<&quot;> by all means, enjoy the delusion of self-reliance, and ignore all the ways you wouldn't be able to have half the things you do without the rest of society chipping in for the public good.

18ssrl,107,c8ibe36,c8hpilw,1.361339399E9,Raised_by_Jews,,4,"1)  There are a number of ways that the free market would be able to deal with pollution.  An insurance type business could be hired by people to monitor air levels and if you, say lived on a lake, monitor the Ph levels of the water.  You would strike a deal with the insurance company that says something along the lines of <&quot;>clean air is expected to be at X amount of excess particles, and the water is expected to be at X Ph levels<&quot;>.  If the air or water excedes those levels then the insurance company would have to pay up, or would be given a certain amount of time (say, a few weeks) to clean up the air and/or water.  This gives the insurance company an incentive to ensure that any companies coming into the area are clean and industrious.

*Example:*

Lets say its a small town that hires the agency, and if air/water pollutants rise the company would have to pay out $100,000.  If a new business comes in, the insurance company would have incentive to pay money to that business to ensure that the technology it uses is clean, and that pollution levels are low.  If the insurance comany pays this then the business would sign a contract ensuring that no excess pollutants would be emitted or else it would be a breach of contract and would have to pay a steep fine.

To keep premiums low, the citizens in that city would want to encourage each other to buy the insurance, and the insurance company would give them monetary incentives (like lower prices) for helping to clean up, and for using environmentally friendly products.

Furthermore, I think the vast majority of people would agree that pollution of private and common property is an act of aggression.  This act of aggression would be permissable to retaliation through legal means which would be much more costly than simply paying something as silly as a carbon tax.  

There is much more to be said about this, but I will be breif on this last point.  If a business is not using public money to improve the land it is on, but instead relying on its own funds, then that business would be more inclined to preserve the state of that land.  Here's a quick example:

A business decides to open up in a secluded area where they can pollute all they want.  To do so they must build the roads and required infrastructure.  This is obviously extremely expensive, so that business would most likely enter into a co-op with other business' who want to open up shop far enough away from residential zones so as not to be sued for pollution.  Now that these businesses have all invested a considerable amount into the land, they would have a direct economic incentive to not destroy the land with excessive pollution.  In this case it would be extremely likely that the businesses all agree to only release X amount of pollutants.  If the businesses decide to not care about pollution, then the value of the property it is on will be virtually non-existent, and all of the resources spent on land improvements will have gone to waste.

2) The cause of food poisoning is almost always easily identifiable.  Even in extreme cases when it is not easily identifiable, a person would still have a narrow list of potential contaminates.  With this list it can easily be deduced as to where the food poisoning occured.  Now let me ask you something, if you were 90% sure that a restaurant you went to gave you food poisoning, would you go back?  Would you ask your friends if they had gotten food poisoning from there?  Would you look online at all of the various third party restaurant review sites to see if anyone else had gotten food poisoning there, and if so what they ate (pro-tip: it's usually the fish)?

Also, it's a little disengenous to compare the food handling practices that restaurants have now to the time before the FDA was created, not to mention the fact that the technology in transportation and food handling is exponentially better now.  To say that the rate of food borne illness has decreased solely because of the FDA is really stretching the truth.  An easier explanation as to why people aren't dieing from food illness is probably because most people are sensible enough to not eat a food that originally gave them food poisoning (although you seem to think that since you can't be 100% certain, then you should just continue to eat the at risk food).

Actually, if you have ever worked in a restaurant, then you should be familiar with the food handlers license.  It is granted by a third party that teaches the restaurants staff how to safely handle and order food so as to minimize the chance of food borne illness.  This is done in spite of the FDA regulations because the restaurants want to have a knowledgeable staff so that food bornie illness doesn't spread, and so as to minimize the risk of lawsuit.  

Another even better example of companies hiring a third party to check the safety of their food is [Aegis Food Tesing Laboratories](http://www.aegisfoodtestinglabs.com/profile.html).  This third party business is hired by companies like Walmart to ensure the quality of their food.  Extra mney is spent by these companies because they want their food to be as safe as possible so as to prevent lawsuit and illness.  This extra money is spent even though there are government agencies like the FDA (who is currently run by Monsanto).  Another third party testing group, but for electronics is UL (Underwriters Laboratories); if you have bought any electronics from Walmart lately, go check the bottom of it, chances are you will see a fat orange UL sticker.

3)
&gt;<&quot;>An informed citizenry with full access to all information<&quot;> is impossible without a unified public effort, AKA, government agencies.

I'm quite certain most people understood that tobbacco was bad for their health, or at the very least not beneficial.  Then again, I expect most people would not continue to eat contaminated hotdogs, present company excluded.  

All jokes aside though, I fail to see how this represents a failure of the free market.  This really just represents a failure on the consumer to do just a small amount of research.  If there is a problem with Capitalism, it would be that it requires work by the consumer.  This laziness on behalf on the vast majority of consumers is what enables the State to grab more power.  I think it is very easily argued that were a vast majority of State programs to <&quot;>protect<&quot;> the consumer (really they are there to encourage monopolies more than anything else), then people would be more inclined to actually do a small amount of work to ensure that the product they got is what they are looking for.  If the person cannot handle doing a small amount of research, then why should I be obligated to pay for a wasteful government program to do the research for them.  What's worse, with this illusion of safety, why do you think that the citizens would even check to make sure that the government agency is doing its job!?  They couldn't even be bothered to do research on something that was immediately effecting them.

&gt;<&quot;>arbitrary levels of <&quot;>clean enough<&quot;>, based on untrained civilians or self-serving private interests.<&quot;>

Because these untrained civilians wouldn't think to hire a specialist to come out and assess what the levels of pollutants should remain below?  As for <&quot;>clean enough<&quot;>, you realize that with our current technology you won't be able to live free of pollutants right?  If you live on a lake and own a boat then there will be trace amounts of gasoline in that lake.  So yes, it would have to be <&quot;>clean enough<&quot;>.  To think you could eradicate all elements of pollutants is absurd.

&gt;Secondly, you're reducing those complex systems to cost-benefit analysis...

And the insurance company would go out of business if it failed to protect the people, because why would they continue to pay for a service that didn't fulfil its end of the bargain?  The people could also make sure that the amount paid out would be enough so as to tip the scales of the cost-benefit analysis in their favor.  As for the bit about the long, expensive legal battles, that is actually what companies do against citizens.  The companies know that they can outlast the vast majority of people in long drawn out court cases, so what you are advocating is actually the opposite of what actually happens.

&gt;<&quot;>It sometimes takes days for the effects of bad food to become evident.<&quot;>

I never said anything to the contrary.  The most occuring event of food poisoning usually takes within 1-6 hours for bacterial, and about 1-4 days for viral, if I recall correctly.  Yes the CDC posts reports that say that the food that caused the illness usually goes undiscovered, but that is because there isn't any incentive to discover the food.  All I was saying is that it usually isn't difficult to narrow the results down based on the illness.  If it turns out that the most likely cause was a restaurant, then a little bit of google-fu should yield more info as to whether or not other people got food poisoning there.  

I actually know a fair amount about foodborne disease as I have worked in the industry for years and majored in restaurant management.  I'm not a doctor or EMT, but everything I have read and seen illustrates that it is not overly difficult in most cases to narrow down the possible infection points.  But hey, I'm glad you chose this one small subject out of everything else I wrote to attack.

So am I led to believe that if the schools were private that they wouldn't be interested in doing research on improving the lives of their fellow man?  Or are you implying that a private college wouldn't be interested in researching a groundbreaking study that if shown to drastically imrpove the health of millions worldwide would lead to world renown?

&gt;<&quot;>Your arrogant assumptions of others and incredibly ignorant assertions leaves me with no interest whatsoever in continuing to debate with you.<&quot;>

The free market has done more for improving inequalities than any government program ever has or ever will do. ¬†In fact, many government programs have done the exact opposite. ¬†Lets consider Elvis Presley for a moment. ¬†Rich Capitalists wanted to make money off of black music, so they found a white man who sounded black. ¬†Suddenly caucasians across America were exposed to black culture (immitation is the highest form of flattery, so to speak). ¬†This made the Capitalists so much money that more and more exposure to black music was demanded, and eventually blacks were finally considered to be equals in terms of music (looking back we can see that clearly blacks had a superior sound in many areas, as it tended to be radically different and ahead of its time), and eventually the record producers began to sign blacks to their record labels! ¬†Even better, since there was more exposure to the radically different sounds, musicians wanted to learn and work together to produce the best possible product, or song, possible. ¬†I think that musicians and artists tend to be some of the most kind and loving people, so all of this would have happened eventually anyways, but had the original capitalist producers not had economic incentive to produce black music, then the rate would have been much slower. ¬†

Here's another example of how Capitalism helped end racism/sexism and promoted egalitarianism:

Lets say there are two businesses. ¬†Business A and business B. ¬†'A' was owned by a sexist man, and 'B' was owned by a man who understood that women are every bit as capable as men. ¬†'A' decided to only hire men, whereas 'B' decided to hire both men and women. ¬†'A' was therefore limiting itself to only 50% of the workforce, whereas 'B' had the entire workforce to choose from. ¬†Therefore 'B' will have a more productive workforce and will be able to outperform 'A'. ¬†Eventually people begin to realize the economic incentives to hire women, and after some time women become standard in the workplace and treated as equals. ¬†All because the owner of company 'B' knew that women were every bit as capable, and knew he could make lots of money off of a bigger selection of the workforce. ¬†This is how Capitalism gives a direct incentive for businesses to treat everyone equally.

5) When you say:

&gt;<&quot;>That means that ensuring that those with the least among us are able to survive long enough to be given a chance to prosper and grow.<&quot;>

You really aren't critiquing the free market, but rather society. ¬†Personally, I am an advocate for the removal of most government programs because they tend to have the effect of telling society that they don't need each other, but that they instead need the government. ¬†I am not saying that this is why those gov. programs came to be, but this is the effect it has had. ¬†State programs take away power and responsibility from the individual and replace it with laziness and disregard. ¬†Instead of people saying <&quot;>how can I help?<&quot;>, they say <&quot;>the government needs to do something about this!<&quot;>. ¬†Capitalism about about voluntary interactions for mutual benefit, and our government and societal interactions should reflect that. ¬†

As I said earlier, if people cannot be bothered to do their own research, then how can we expect them to be sure the government is doing it effectively and fairly? ¬†This applies even more so in regards to charity and supporting those who are inable to support themselves. ¬†It is easy to not worry because the government will take care of a problem, but that does not mean it is compassionate, and it certainly does not mean it will be effective. ¬†But if someone is down on their luck and a local church or community center donates time and resources to help that person out, then you can be damn sure those groups will be sure that the person doesn't take advantage of their genorosity, and actually gets back on their feet instead of being a parasite. ¬†Basically, this encourages people to think like Capitalists, to try to get the most out of their investment &gt;: )

There is, however, a free market way to solve many societal problems. ¬†Lets take the problem of the homeless. ¬†There was a study done in Las Vegas (pretty sure it was LV, it was in a Malcolm Gladwell book I read some time ago) in which a gov. program gave housing and jobs to the homeless. ¬†Most, if not all of the homeless in the program suffered from some sort of mental illness or drug addiction (usually alcholism, iirc). ¬†While the homeless person was in the rigid control of the program he/she was able to regain semblance of a 'normal' life, and was turned into a productive member of society. ¬†The jobs were all very basic jobs, dishwashers, janitors, etc., and they regularly had to meet with healthworkers to ensure they remained on task, but overall the [former] homeless enjoyed a much higher quality of life, and were much happier. ¬†After a while the person would be deemed fit for society and would be allowed more freedom. ¬†Unfortunately, with this freedom the person would almost always turn back to drugs, and eventually the program was dismantled. ¬†Now here is my proposal: ¬†the free market does everything better than the government, so there is very little reason to wonder why it can't improve upon this system of turning the homeless into model citizens for everyone's benefit. ¬†If the company doing this gets to keep a portion of the income, then it is in everyone's benefit. ¬†Further, the company would have reason to invest in that homeless person after a while and get them schooling which would make them more marketable and get higher wages which would earn the company more money. ¬†Is this all a guarenteed success? ¬†Absolutely not. ¬†But so long as people default to the logic of <&quot;>the gov. will take care of the problem<&quot;>, then innovation and compassion will continue to be stifled.",,null,null,,0.038,0.799,0.163,0.9993,20,6,37,33,172,176,85,202,304

Except your example is a fantasy hypothetical that's the exact OPPOSITE of what happened in reality.  Government had to step in and FORCE companies to not discriminate against others by age, gender, race, etc, because corporations were perfectly happy to continue to discriminate in hiring and promotion based on age, race, gender, etc.

&gt;5) Instead of people saying <&quot;>how can I help?<&quot;>, they say <&quot;>the government needs to do something about this!<&quot;>

Except scores of workers and volunteers at homeless shelters, soup kitchens and other social programs are liberals who believe in government support of those in poverty, which utterly dismantles your presumption.

&gt;As I said earlier, if people cannot be bothered to do their own research, then how can we expect them to be sure the government is doing it effectively and fairly? 

Because an individual cannot spend all their time and resources doing research, while a government employee tasked to do research as their JOB has the training and experience to do so.

&gt;Now here is my proposal:  the free market does everything better than the government

Utterly specious assertion: the free market is often more EFFICIENT than the government, but that is purely in terms of profits, not necessarily true for services.

&gt;so there is very little reason to wonder why it can't improve upon this system of turning the homeless into model citizens for everyone's benefit.

Except for the fact that companies have absolutely 0 incentive to take high risk investments on individuals with histories and contexts that indicate low returns.  Any CEO that attempts to do that would be voted out by their board of investors before they could say <&quot;>public relations improvement.<&quot;>

&gt;But so long as people default to the logic of <&quot;>the gov. will take care of the problem<&quot;>, then innovation and compassion will continue to be stifled.

The fact that you think the government stifles innovation and compassion is amazing to me, considering how much innovation and compassion has come as a result of people working together for the common good (aka, government) rather than people working for their own benefit (aka, private interests).

Ever hear of the internet?  Kind of a big deal. One of many advancements in science funded by the government.

We're done here. I hope you find other places to educate yourself before you continue to blaze a trail of ignorance across the internet like this: a simple google search would have saved you from some of the immense blunders you asserted as facts in these two posts, which is ironic considering how often you lamented people's inability or unwillingness to <&quot;>do the basic research.<&quot;>",,null,null,,0.055,0.783,0.162,0.9949,11,2,16,16,184,195,36,102,123

From what I understand, quantum behavior is observed to be non-deterministic. Quantum mechanics uses probabilistic (non-deterministic) equations to describe and predict quantum behavior. But explanations for why the behavior appears non-deterministic can be either deterministic or non-deterministic. 

Because of the [uncertainty principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle), we have reached a limit to how much we can know about what is happening at the quantum level because every time we try observe what is happening, [we change the outcome](http://jennyty.multiply.com/video/item/33/Futurama-clip-on-Heisenbergs-uncertainty-principle?&amp;show_interstitial=1&amp;u=%2Fvideo%2Fitem). We can't gather anymore information about what could be causing the behavior without affecting the system, thus we can only guess why the behavior appears the way it does. Some of these explanations are non-derterminist, and some explanations are deterministic; and some of these deterministic explanations, such as the local hidden variable hypothesis, have been disproven. 

The Copenhagen interpretation does not make the additional assumption that unknown or unobservable deterministic variables are governing the non-deterministic observations. It asserts that quantum behaviors appear to be non-deterministic because quantum behavior is non-deterministic. Quantum behavior is weird and non-intuitive to our primate brains, and we may develop better explanations for quantum behavior in the future. But for now, the Copenhagen interpretation assumes the least and explains the most, which is probably why it's the most accepted interpretation.

&gt;Theoretically it was be equally unfree... Yes it does seem absurd to suggest people don't really want to do things or have intentions.

Does this theoretical evaluation not then conflict with the everyday judgments you surely make? That is, don't you distinguish between what people do intentionally, as opposed to unintentionally? If not, how do you ascribe blame or praise?

How do you assess a situation in which one has done harm? Do you simply take him or her to be always-evenly morally reprehensible, regardless of his or her intentions? Or do you entirely excuse everyone who causes harm; and judge everyone who has made an achievement as being unworthy of praise due to their lack of involvement in bringing about said achievement? Do you chalk all achievements up to luck?

&gt;But the principle behind psychological determinism wouldn't be that we don't want to do things or have intentions, rather you can't really willfully change these intentions. Our intentions are molded by our surroundings.

Is this entirely true? Aren't our past intentions, desires, and plans part of the past events that shape the present and future? Don't we often decide what our future intentions will be? For example: Does one not decide that they will intend, if it is within their power, to eat a certain way when they choose to take up a diet?

Of course one could go on asking about what external factors have been involved in causing one's every intention indefinitely - finding, each time, a chain of events that reach far beyond one's scope of awareness; but does a web of external causal factors eliminate the possibility of internal causes (i.e. causes from within the agent's mind - specifically intentions, desires, plans)? Furthermore, how pertinent is a unidirectional focus on external causes to how we form judgments about freewill in practice? To what extent is a blanket application of such a line of inquiry useful or relevant to the situations that call for evaluations of willfulness?

&gt;The presence of any will, intentions, choice, or favor is determined by complicated metabolic reaction experiencing stimulus that is out of your control, thus any life you lead is just the logical result of your body experiencing a series of events.

Yes, I agree, there are biological and neurophysiological correlates to all our experiences and actions - but I don't see how this eliminates willful acts; and I don't see how this would delegitimize or threaten the way we ascribe willfulness to behaviors (how this would problematize the way we say <&quot;>he/she acted by his/her own freewill<&quot;>).

Do you not find it problematic that by your view, you must always appeal to a presumed quality of insurmountability regarding the term, <&quot;>freewill<&quot;>? That is, do you not see a problem with disregarding any other definition of <&quot;>freewill<&quot;>, in exchange for such a metaphysically demanding notion; a notion of a God-like sense of autonomy, in which one can do anything possible or impossible?

How can such a state even be appropriated within an argument as being for or against any specific conclusion? Aren't there absurdities and paradoxes that are inherent to such a state? For example: If one had boundless freewill (the power to do anything), would he or she be able to make him or herself not have freewill?

2)Hard determinism is not true.

When they are followed, people get along better, in my experience. Society and the families that comprise them have rules, formal and informal, to structure people's roles, talents, and flaws into a workable system. If people only do things because it's deserved, you'll have to reinvent the societal wheel. If you do things because we, as a culture, have placed value on older people, then the positive values of respect, courtesy, and kindness are reinforced and hopefully paid forward. 

Older people have been around longer than you (Plot Twist: you're old!). That very reality gives them a different place in society, not better or worse, just different. The niceties of daily interaction, while vanishing, are the fabric that let us trust each other, communicate effectively, and maybe even bring a bit of pleasantness to people's lives. When you defer to someone, you are acknowledging that their needs are different from yours. I, an able-bodied woman, should always give up my seat for pregnant women, tired people, people with kids, and old people. Do they *deserve* it? Probably not. But the symbol of the gesture is more meaningful than the actual action. In a very primal way, I acknowledge that their situation is more dire than mine and I hope to have the same treatment if I'm ever pregnant/ tired/ old. 

Would you talk politics with a child? Would you speak to your father-in-law how you do on boys' night out? Do you let your wife parallel park? (okay, that part was just for comic relief, but you see the point). Probably not because roles and situations negate behavior.

The argument always seems to boil down to semantics (and the occasional die-hard pessimist/angsty freshman who just read Kant for the first time).  Many people, when posing your argument, imply that a <&quot;>selfish<&quot;> action is one which could possibly have *any* benefit whatsoever for the doer, and if it is beneficial for the doer (even in as slight and subjective a way as <&quot;>feeling good about doing something good for someone else<&quot;>), it is therefore a selfish action.  

However, according to the dictionary, for someone or something to be selfish it is <&quot;>lacking consideration for others; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure.<&quot;>  The key word there is <&quot;>chiefly<&quot;>; every definition I came across has that same modifier, or some synonym.  So a selfish action is not one that has some secondary benefit for the doer, but one for which the primary motivation is the doer's self interest (more specifically, the doer's self interest without consideration to how it might effect others).

Reddit philosophers often cite extreme examples of how people perform acts of kindness in the face of a direct threat to their own well being (i.e. the response about the holocaust), but these cases don't inherently stand up logically to the perennial argument of <&quot;>but the doer simply did it to 'feel good' or to 'avoid feeling bad'<&quot;>. 

I would offer a more mundane example: you walk out of a building, noticing out of the corner of your eye someone a couple paces behind you. On your way out the door, you stop for a brief moment to hold the door open. After the person behind you takes the door and/or walks through, you go about the rest of your day without a second thought.  Now *maybe* you have a door holding fetish, and you get off every time someone walks through a door you've just held open, but the odds are this was a selfless act of compassion (<&quot;>I wouldn't want a door to slam in my face, so that person behind me probably wouldn't either, so I'll hold the door for a second<&quot;>).  Small acts of kindness like this happen all the time: you get to an intersection at the same time as someone else and you let them go first; you see someone drop a glove on the subway and you point it out to them.  And just to reiterate, I am not saying that these actions can't/don't have some gratification for the doer, but this is not the primary motivating factor, therefore not selfish.

My final comment to a skeptic: try not to undermine the goodwill of your fellow human beings.  If you can find true compassion within yourself, then it does, irrevocably, exist.",1,c8k2iyp,null,,0.101,0.769,0.129,0.9614,6,5,11,19,182,162,53,95,133

Can you explain a bit more what you mean by this? I just wanted to define altruism in a narrow way by using an extreme case to show the potential of mankind. I don't believe the random acts of kindness you cite truly encapsulate the degree of good humans are capable of. Sure, they show a general concern for others, but these are very convenient favors that have very little effect on people at the end of the day. I think it is the extreme cases that really show our potential. When you put someone else's well-being ahead of your own, I believe that says something much larger about our capacity.

You don't specify the logical error inherent to these extreme cases, I am confused. Shelterers had much greater concerns than their psychological rewards. They put themselves at immense risk for the sake of strangers. As such, it is really hard for me to imagine any scenario where someone *selfishly* sheltered Jews.

Again, I do not agree with that claim and I am in no way suggesting that people who perform heroic acts are behaving selfishly, but it is hard, if not impossible, to deny the fact that in performing an act of kindness (especially one of such gravity), the doer does have some feeling of emotional reward (or at least, the avoidance of a negative emotional toll, i.e. guilt).

Perhaps a psychological reward of sorts, but you couldn't argue that any rational person would desire that ego boost so badly that they would risk their own lives.

There was a small town in France where a local preacher set up networks of shelterers. He simply created a culture given his position of power, and convinced his people to do what was right. You could argue that people simply acted as their neighbors did, <&quot;>keeping up with the Jones's<&quot;> or something, but even still, these non-Jews put themselves at such great risk.

For a really simplistic example, let's say you need a new wrench. You can buy it from KKK Tools Inc, or Home Depot. If you buy it from KKK Tools Inc, some portion of your money is almost certainly going to go to catering the next klan meeting. If Home Depot has the same wrench for the same price, the decision is easy. It's not that you will become more racist by buying the wrench from KKK Tools Inc, but you will be spending your money in a way that runs counter to your beliefs. If the wrench is slightly more expensive, it's still worth it to many people to pay a premium not to support racism. If enough people stand by their views, KKK Tools Inc will go out of business and the KKK will be deprived of that revenue. Since that's in general what people want, they'll buy the wrench at Home Depot. Pretty straightforward, yes?

But his books are not a commodity. There are other sci-fi books, but there is no other Ender's Game. If you refuse to buy it you're paying a premium not in money, but in lost quality, to avoid sending your money to someone who is going to use it for causes you oppose.

I was and am creeped out by this; this man was making private donations he earned from a job that had ziltch to do with marriage or discrimination.  If you are happy to destroy his livelihood over this, why not require all bike shops to post on their windows their opinions about abortion, gay marriage, drone warfare, and so on?  Why not require all your employees at work to disclose their voting records, or sign agreements they won't use their incomes for particular causes?  Hitching your wagon to such a boycott seems to take us to a very dark place.

At the same time, though, we should consider that our dollars are in many ways a form of voting.

A friend had a Hecate ritual she wanted to perform at a crossroads at midnight. Another friend and I came along to observe and make sure she didn't get mugged. We weren't participating at all, or especially expecting to do anything besides stand quietly for twenty minutes and then walk our friend home.

Our friend dug a small hole in the ground for the grave dirt she was planning to bury. Before and after this I think she was also praying - I don't know, because she was silent. Then she lifted up a bottle of honey, a traditional offering to Hecate. Nothing about the way she did this was particularly notable. 

But suddenly, I felt something there. There was something dark and scary in the night - the kind of thing you hide from under your covers as a kid. The kind of thing that makes you want to run instead of walk down the dark streets or path at night, but you know you can't because if you run it will chase you, so you force yourself to walk.

My friend finished her ritual and we walked her home. The creepy feeling slowly melted away. We talked about the ritual, and I discovered both of my other friends had felt the same presence starting at the same instant. 

Now, this would be explainable if we'd all psyched ourselves up about that moment, or if someone had yelled, <&quot;>Let the goddess of scary things be present!<&quot;> or even if one of us had gone, <&quot;>hey psst, do you feel that?<&quot;> But none of that happened. We all experienced a very strong, very unique feeling that none of us had expected to feel, with no external cue that told us to feel it.

I'm sure if you're a hardcore non-believer you could come up with reasons. And I have tried. But at this point Occam's Razor is on the side of the supernatural - it is most likely that some presence was drawn there, and we all felt it.

However, that's true for me. If you're a non-believer reading this, Occam's Razor says that the most likely explanation is that I'm lying. It's the simplest and easiest thing that makes sense.

Selective exposure to confirmatory information makes us comfortable and reaffirms our intellectual prowess which can be threatened when opposing views are presented. Blind spots prevent us from acknowledging or processing material that creates conflict or dissonance. Our opinions tend to be habitually self-serving, and I am as guilty as any person despite the deluded sense of clarity that a fascination with perceptual vigilance grants my ego.

That being said, media bias is a well documented phenomenon. They very often paint groups with a broad brush, and not an especially nice one if said group is a perceived threat to their particular brand of slant.

The totalizing of devout religious followers as mentally unhinged is as popular with liberal media as framing all homosexuals as ridiculously flamboyant and hyper-sexual is with conservative media. There is no such thing as unbiased media as it is produced by and pandered to (a big contributor to polarizing and personal politics) biased people.

The New Atheist movement has popularized a more brutal treatment of religion in general that its celebrated minds claim it deserves. (sidenote: a quick glance at its philosophical arguments reveals an unmistakable lack of rigor. They have yet to demonstrate any familiarity with the actual arguments of historic theist philosophers, and have instead chosen to predominantly focuses on the same easy target, Rev. William Paley.)

Similarly, movements in western civilization in the last 300 years or so have pushed a narrow definition of intelligence and intellectualism that generally limits it to those who espouse non-religion or atheism, similar to the way Christianity monopolized the idea of being a <&quot;>good person<&quot;>. The stereotype of religion being incompatible with intelligence is an old one.

Perhaps most importantly, religion has a history of being a sanctuary for those who are actually mentally ill. Religious institutions can be extremely caring and accepting of many of society's outcasts (the sick, poor, etc.). Perhaps religious traditions are sustained more frequently in families with hereditary mental illness merely due to the fact that it is a viable social support system not found anywhere else.

 My point is that intelligence doesn't immediately equate to superiority. The most intelligent person you know may not be the most fun to hang out with. In fact, I'm willing to bet that the person you find the most entertaining isn't as smart as you are.

Since having 32 teeth is a verifiable fact, equating the religious with people who believe everyone has 34 teeth is like saying that they are refusing to acknowledge a basic truth. In reality, the existence of any divine power or underlying universal theology can neither be fully proven nor disproven. You make it sound like there is cold, hard evidence that any sort of God does not exist, and that to deny it would be ignorant, when in reality that isn't the case.

Likewise, you also portray the religious as only believing because they were raised that way.

You've just proven you know nothing about the term atheism. Atheism by definition means the LACK of a belief in a god or gods. [Here, let me just link you this Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_atheism). It explains more comprehensively than I can.

I am an atheist, but that does NOT mean I KNOW that no god exists. It simply means I do not believe there is one, and that there is no reason to believe in one. It is COMPLETELY different from asserting that no god could possibly exist. There are VERY few atheists that think like this, and you have been misinformed by negative propaganda if you think otherwise.

You seem to think atheism is some sort of weird religion based around the concept of no gods. Not only is this wrong because [religion by definition centers around belief in a deity](http://www.google.ca/#hl=en&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=religion+definition&amp;oq=religion+definition&amp;gs_l=hp.12...0.0.1.2518.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0.les%3B..0.0...1c..4.psy-ab.TBTcL8N2PsE&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.42768644,d.dmg&amp;fp=e15db191cba4d770&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=737), but also because ATHEISM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SPIRITUALITY.

I guess I should explain myself. Reading your front page, the sub seemed quite impartial when dealing with controversial topics. It looked like a great place to have a real meeting of the minds on all sorts of issues. So I checked out your top posts; and the one on circumcision had some great arguments from both sides, but seemed a bit one-sided. That's acceptable; after all, the truth rarely rests in the middle between two opposing positions - it's invatriably closer to one or the other.

But then I read this thread, and it was so dissappointing.

The law of conservation of mass says that all matter and energy in a closed system cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. The universe is the sum total of all matter and energy, and it is a closed system since it literally encompasses everything.

Therefore, according to the law of conservation of mass, the universe cannot be created or destroyed. The only logical conclusion is that the universe has always existed, in one form or the other. I don't know how it did it, or how to prove my theory, but if the law of conservation of mass holds true (which it always has), I don't see how the universe could have been created (or be destroyed) by anything.

Which also brings me to another conclusion. If the universe has always existed, and has been constantly expanding at the speed of light for the last 15 billion years, then time and space are INFINITE. Space stretches infinitely in all directions, which explains how the universe can constantly expand, and time itself must have no beginning or endpoint, but instead keeps on going in a never-ending stream because universe, and creation itself, cannot have a beginning or end point due to the law of conservation.

I believe that Christianity is not only perfectly rational, but the *most* rational worldview. The 3 modes of persuasion, as you may or may not know, are logos, pathos, and ethos - logic, emotion, and the reliability of the speaker, respectively. I have been convinced on all three fronts. Briefly:

*Logos*: There is a discipline called Christian apologetics that seeks to give logical arguments in favor of the existence of God and authenticity of the Bible. I won't spend much time on this, because there are many different arguments with varying levels of persuasiveness; but [here](http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/) is one basic argument presented in an easily-digested format, and [this little book](http://www.amazon.com/More-Than-Carpenter-Josh-McDowell/dp/1414326270/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361676351&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=more+than+a+carpenter) contains several good answers to rational objections to Christianity. I encourage you to look into apologetics further, as these are just basic resources.

*Pathos*: This is obviously quite subjective, so I won't spend long discussing it. But the tenets and stories of the Bible have stirred emotions of all kinds in me; and since becoming a Christian, I have been happier and more emotionally stable than ever before. It seems ironic, considering how many laws and restrictions the Bible puts on Christians, but I feel happier for following them.

*Ethos*: Christianity can be seen as a worldview and a lifestyle, and if that's the case, those who have preached it to me have been very much qualified to do so. I have the blessing of attending a church where nearly everyone who attempts to follow the Bible's teachings, from the leaders to the members, is (or appears to be) happy, successful, kind, compassionate, financially responsible, emotionally stable, social, and humble. They solve disputes through dialogue and mutual understanding. Many of them have successful marriages and families. Generally, all the aspects of <&quot;>having one's life together<&quot;> are apt descriptors of them. When these people tell me they know how I should live my life, I listen. 

In telling you all this, I'm not trying to convince you to become a Christian (although that would be a welcome side effect). I'm simply trying to describe to you how **one can be a rational, intelligent person and still be a Christian**. Even if what I've provided doesn't convince you, if you can see how someone else might be convinced by it, I'll have accomplished my goal. 

As a final note, it is very easy to assume that those who disagree with you are fools and should not be respected, and people of all beliefs and walks of life make that assumption every day. To seek a higher view of religious outgroup members is a noble and commendable goal. Kudos to you.

It's mostly a frustration: they think or debate so rationally on other things like politics, but holds a double-standard for their beliefs when it comes to their religion.

One thing to keep in mind is that not everyone has the same rigors for rationality or thresholds for belief.  Some people look into the evidence of their beliefs, examine counterarguments, weigh opposing perspectives.  Others don't: they accept beliefs by authority, or popularity.

**And this isn't strictly about religion vs atheism:** that's just the dichotomy we're primed to see based on our outlook.  If you were a lawyer, say, you would probably be really frustrated with other lawyers who don't dig into the <&quot;>rationality<&quot;> of the law, but rather just stick to precedent and tradition.

Furthermore, many religious people have no INCENTIVE to examine their beliefs.  Their beliefs make them happy. Their family is full of believers.  They engage in social activities that have meaning due to their beliefs.

And furthermore, they don't believe in any of the crazy or stupid stuff. They believe mostly as watered down, philosophical tenets, with a few miraculous origins thrown in.

To the <&quot;>liberal<&quot;> or <&quot;>progressive<&quot;> religious folk, there's absolutely no reason to critically examine their belief.  We on the other side might wish they would for various reasons, namely because the silent, supportive majority gives credibility to the loud and destructive minority, on a personal level, why would they care if their religion is true or not?  What INCENTIVE do they have to care?

I've come to the point where I mostly just say it's enough that they're progressive, enough that they support secular government and don't impose their religious beliefs on others.  As long as those are shared values, I acknowledge that not everyone has to be equal in everything, there are some things they're better than me at, and while I hope someday they come around to critically examining ALL their beliefs, they don't NEED to to live a happy and fulfilling life.

- The fact that they (Christians in the US anyways) give more to charity and report being happier overall than non-religious people according to reputable sources (Pew surveys for example). Related, the fact that they seem to have stronger/healthier (church-based/related) communities overall, with the numerous benefits that this tends to confer on an individuals mental health.

I think one of the best ways to CYV is to think about something that you used to believe and took for granted without evidence, but now no longer believe.

One example I use is eating meat. I still have no strong issue with people eating meat (I think because it is ingrained in me), and I used to eat meat all the time. But, I do not know of any evidence that suggests eating animals is morally acceptable. Yet, if you asked people why they think it's okay, there might be any number of weak reasons:

1. <&quot;>Animals eat each other in the wild and we are just animals. So it's no different.<&quot;> In fact, we are quite different than other animals and, with our long societal evolution, no longer need to eat animals (except for the few small groups of people on the Earth). Unlike most animals, killing is morally reprehensible to most humans, so again we are different; we do not need to ignore our morals when we do not actually need to eat animals.

2. <&quot;>Animals are lesser, so it's okay to kill them.<&quot;> This argument is vague. I'm not sure what lesser means: less feeling, no self-awareness, can't add numbers? I don't think we have a strong understanding of the sentience of animals or their emotions. If a person thinks the only reason they themselves should not be killed is because they can add numbers, then I suppose they would be consistent in thinking killing animals is fine. However, I do no think this is generally the case. Moreover, I think most people would not eat their pets, for example, which seems to contradict this point. 

3. <&quot;>We need the meat for a balanced diet.<&quot;> This is just not true.

At this point, it is an *opinion* without any real evidence; but the justifications *feel* like evidence. And we've been told our wholes lives that it's fine. Most people never see how animals are raised and slaughtered; it's almost like they implicitly believe in magical meat production that is humane. For some people, eating meat is now a way of life, defining a part of them; changing that would be very difficult. And, of course, maybe eating animals IS good, I just haven't heard good evidence for it.

Or if <&quot;>Happiness<&quot;> is the purpose of the universe, then things like Truth or Justice are relegated to unimportance.  Just find a way to make everyone high all the time, and suddenly you've achieved perfection, even if it's based on a lie, even if it's unjust  to some or most.

But when you remove a universal <&quot;>purpose,<&quot;> then you simply free people to pursue what they find important, with others who share their values.  Music. Science. Stories. Sports.  Charity. Art. Love. Whatever brings them fulfillment, makes them happy, makes life better for others.

And of course some people will value less savory things, or place their own values over others to the point of stealing or murdering or rape.  As a society, we thus struggle to promote the positive, constructive values while discouraging and containing the negative.

But ultimately, mankind's destiny is in our own hands.

Not everyone is the same, of course. But I think many people would rather live a comforting lie than investigate the truth if it might bring them pain.  That's the root of Cognitive Dissonance.

But to do this well we need to not only produce more copies of our own DNA (by breeding), we need to also give our DNA the best chance of continuing to replicate for as many generations as possible. However we don't clone ourselves over and over, each of us continually reproducing the same set of DNA. Instead we breed with others of our species and pass our DNA on in chunks that are mixed with other strands. We're therefore faced with the problem of worrying not just about <&quot;>What's best for my particular set of DNA?<&quot;> (i.e, me), but rather <&quot;>What's best for the DNA of my species?<&quot;>

Acting for the good of your species, rather than just yourself means that actions which benefit just oneself, while doing harm to a significant number of others are counterproductive - they actually *reduce* the chances of your DNA continuing to replicate. Conversely, an action which may have a *minor* detriment on one's self, but which benefits others is likely to increase the chance of your DNA continuing to replicate.

For all of this to work, humans need to survive. But we don't live in a vacuum - we **all** rely on other species for our food. *Everyone* relies on plants - even a 100% meat diet is impossible unless at least one animal in the chain has plants to feed on. But even vegans rely on animals, because something has to pollinate the plants. And we need a variety of plants, which in turn require a variety of pollinators, which may in turn need to feed on and live in yet more varieties of plants. Then you've got predators which keep other populations in check &amp; ensure they don't wipe out their own food supply.

The inherent purpose of everyone's life is to maximise the chance of our species's continued survival (evolving is OK, dieing out is not).

It's more just a life goal -- it's 100% of the reason you're here. You were designed by nature to pass on your genes. If you can accept the fact that the true purpose of life isn't quite the storybook fantasy that religion had you hoping for, then the truth (that you're here to compete) can actually be really exciting. The difference with other animals, and the source of a lot of our confusion, is that as humans our prime directive has already been completed. We've mastered the art of survival, leaving little for us to do but continue to live. We've already secured all the food and protection we need to physically survive, so... what do we do? Yay, we won?

No. You can still compete, but now it's for other things. Compete to find the most attractive mate. You can compete in your job industry. Advance technology. Create something beautiful. Be remembered. Most of all, take care of the human race.

For example, even in a film as beloved as Donnie Darko, there was one black character, and he was a janitor that spoke in <&quot;>ebonics<&quot;>. This might not seem like a big deal in and of itself, however, in conjunction with many other films (anything involving Martin Lawrence or the Wayan Brothers being cases in point) it reinforces and perpetuates all sorts of negative stereotypes regarding black people and their perceived behaviour.

This is without  even mentioning the tropes that hip hop portrays regarding black masculinity (A good place to start is [It's Bigger Than Hip-Hop: The Rise of the Post Hip Hop Generation](http://www.amazon.com/Its-Bigger-Than-Hip-Hop/dp/0312593023). You might say that this is music produced by black artists, and you'd be correct, but the industry is run by the record company owners, who are without fail, white, middle aged men.

Women are represented terribly also. The substantial proportion of characters in films fall into the  [Angel/Whore](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGirlIsNotASlut) categories. Female roles are incredibly poorly written and the number of films that don't pass the [Bechdel Test](http://bechdeltest.com/) is, quite frankly, staggering.

This is without even mentioning stuff like women being demonised for being too large, or too skinny, or looking less than perfect in magazines written by women for women, or treated like a sexual commodity in advertising, or being blamed for being sexually assaulted because of previous sexual experience.

I don't think you had to read about these things because of your immediate environment. Nearly everything that you consume will challenge the feminist and civil rights literature that you've read, mostly very subtly indeed.

First of all, the Pygmalion effect works both ways, so if a specific ethnicity or gender has higher expectations placed on them, they will perform at a higher level, so for you to strongly imply that it only has negative effects is completely incorrect.

Secondly, using something as an example doesn't mean I'm <&quot;>flummoxed<&quot;> by it. It just means it was noted and is an egregious example of a minority having employment and conforming to what is expected of that ethnic group. That is a better representation of the Pygmalion effect than the way you used it. Furthermore, in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194xqq/i_do_not_think_historical_racism_or_sexism_should/c8l3wb4), two studies are cited that indicate that white, male children gain self esteem from watching television, while almost all other subsets do not. If the Pygmalion effect was applied to this, it would indicate that white male children are receiving positive reinforcement from the media.

Thirdly, I do not see why an equalitarian debate is necessary on this thread, in response to OPs question, If I seem to be hostile, then it's because I feel you are pushing an agenda, whereas I was merely providing an argument for why I consider it's necessary to read about two oppressed groups during education.

Your original post smacks of the <&quot;>What about the menz?!<&quot;> bullshit that so often comes up when ever it's mentioned on Reddit that some groups are disadvantaged.

My agreement with your very broad statement is because it is true, up to a point. However, advertising uses stereotypes for men (and women) because they don't have long to get their message across and using easily identified tropes is the easiest way to do this. I'd still say that perpetuating the idea that women are sexual commodities is both different from, and far more damaging than portraying a man as a buffoon, simply because one dehumanises a gender, and one doesn't. As for movies, the vast majority of the stereotypes that apply to white males are positive. So while that is an issue, it's an issue in the sense that it implies superiority over other subsets of society, rather than inferiority, as the way ethnic minorities and women are handled do.

I did not know of those studies. Growing up in the nineties, it did not feel like positive reinforcement at all to me, but I guess how I interpret things might be different from how another white guy may interpret them. Barring the inevitable Stallone-like alpha males, I don't feel like I've seen many positive male role models. Then again, it's only a personal feeling, but it should hint at the possibility that we don't get that much positive reinforcement.

To be fair, regardless of whom it depicts advertising is almost always soul-crushingly bad and morally objectionable. Although I do take issue with the way men are depicted in commercials, I think the way men are depicted in other forms of media is even worse.

The casual depiction of both female-on-male and male-on-male violence is by far the worst offender, insofar as it maintains as socially acceptable an abject form of (ironically) patriarchy-inherited male disposability. Also, keep in mind that for every John McClane, there tends to be an equally male and equally white villain counterpart.

I'm quite certain that none of us want a full fledged debate about MR, but just as a reminder: the issues that (some) men face have economic, legal and health-related ramifications too. It's not just about being depicted as buffoons in commercials.

As far as the other subsets of society are concerned, life is not a suffering contest. There are ways of addressing the plights faced by all of the different communities and I think that choosing which community deserves, or does not deserve, preferential treatment is tantamount to playing God.

Edit: forgot about the equalitarian part. Well I believe that this type of debate can only be understood through the framework of ending historical inequalities and, consequently, reaching a better state of equality. This is merely a logical premise.

Not everyone grows up where you did, or had the same experiences and perspective.  This is obvious in retrospect, but many people have trouble realizing at first that their own experiences and childhoods are not the norm.  While you may have been sitting in class thinking <&quot;>Okay, duh,<&quot;> it might not have been as obvious to others.

&gt;Educators and individuals who prescribe such a heavy emphasis on racist and sexist social issues can have the reverse and a negative effect on students. Re-emphasizing wrongs of the past as if they were ripe and thriving in that age group, and insisting that framing white males as <&quot;>villains who can never be wronged<&quot;> is compensated by natural biases in society that will boost their confidence is merely am excuse for more racism and sexism. 

Please point to the piece of media you have seen or read that makes you think the author was implying <&quot;>it's okay to hate white men.<&quot;>  I think your next point gives the context for this perception fairly well:

&gt;The system I went through can project guilt onto sensitive individuals that can effect them for the rest of their lives.

Guilt and sensitivity are uncomfortable feelings. But no one MAKES you feel them: they are your reaction to things around you. Even if some abusive teacher took you aside and said <&quot;>Look Jimmy. Look at all that shit your ancestors did. That makes you a terrible person. You are a terrible person!<&quot;> not only would that teacher be fired so fast her idiotic head would spin, but it's still up to the individual to be rational and mature enough to say <&quot;>No. The sins of the father do not pass down to the son. I've done nothing wrong, and being aware of my privileges does not mean I'm taking advantage of them or perpetuating them.<&quot;>

However: racism and sexism are deplorable **realities.**  They are IMPOSED on you by others' actions.  While it's up to the individual woman or minority to recognize their self-worth and do their best not let others' opinions of them affect them, there are still ACTIONS others take that can negatively effect them, and they still live with the legacy of older generations' prejudices.

What you are essentially saying is that your feelings of assumed guilt are more important than spreading awareness of those  historical events and social norms, which are still experienced today.

Let's be clear here: if any teacher, any kid, any one at all tried to tell you that you were a villain, that you ARE guilty of things you had nothing to do with, or even of things your parents or great grandparents did, **they were wrong.**

But that is not how this material is taught.  And it's not why it's taught.

It's taught so that new generations are aware of cultural history.  It's taught so that minorities and women, who have to still live with prejudice in our modern culture, know the struggles that have come before to make the progress that has been made.

Could it stand to be paired down a bit in some respects? Absolutely. 20 books in 4 years about slavery seems excessive, but it also seems like hyperbole: do you count Huckleberry Finn as a book <&quot;>about slavery?<&quot;>  Is To Kill a Mockingbird <&quot;>about civil rights?<&quot;>

They contain in them the realities of the time the stories are set in, but they are not heavy handed parables meant to bash a message into people's faces.

If you feel sensitivity or guilt, I am sorry.

But as long as the material isn't taught in the express purpose of achieving that, which it never has been from any way I've seen, then it's just not as important as raising awareness of social issues and history.

Suck it up like I did, like millions of others do, and realize you are not part of the problem, but part of the solution.  Don't apologize for what your ancestors may or may not have done, but don't brush it under the rug either.  Take that guilt and make it constructive: that's what guilt is for.  To bring about change.

Best of all, develop a sense of humor about it:

It is important to know that African Americans were oppressed, and even more important that we know *how* they were oppressed, and justifications given for the treatment.

Now, reading 20 books about how much it sucked to be black might not help anyone, I'll agree to that. But certainly a curriculum designed around teaching students how institutional oppression is organized and conducted is needed. It would help us identify those signs today and avoid going down that dark path again. We learn history so that we can learn from our mistakes. It isn't enough to know that black Americans were oppressed. We need to know how we justified it to the public, how we tried to delay change, how we managed to affect change, and *why* we went through all this trouble in the first place. Otherwise, we might not see signs of the same thing happening today on a smaller scale.

I'll give you an example. It is illegal and morally unacceptable today to institute a poll tax or a literacy test for voting. The reason for this being that both of those methods were used to keep black men and women, once freed, from voting. Because we have learned that lesson, we are better tuned to detecting oppressive election legislation. We know when they're trying to cheat us out of a vote.

Another: We are now more wary of using biological or naturalistic <&quot;>arguments<&quot;> to justify keeping people down. <&quot;>But the women don't really *want* to leave the house!

My point is basically that while the White Guilt style of teaching is flawed (mostly because it's a really lazy way of addressing the problem.

The same is true for chemistry, where learning about how organic chemistry is sufficient to proceed to synthesis. Rarely, if ever, does one need to know about the nitty-gritty of physics to produce the right molecule. 

In the case of psychology, one can learn more than enough from clinical trials. In fact, we've yet to figure out enough about the neurochemistry for biologists to derive that information alone.

&gt; astrophysics versus particle physics

think about two paradigms of mechanics in physics: quantum mechanics and classical mechanics. Classical mechanics, such as that contributed to by Newton, was how we did physics for hundreds of years before we developed the resources and insight to deal with quantum physics. But, it turns out that all of classical physics, via the [correspondence principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_principle), can in principle be described precisely by quantum physics. Since this correspondence exists, why not discard classical physics in favour of quantum physics? The reason we don't do this is because even the conceptually simplest of problems, say, kicking a ball, are so much more effort in a quantum paradigm, so much so that they are virtually intractable. But since we have this correspondence, we can say that the classical interpretation of the ball, since the system is macroscopic, is close enough to that that you might derive from the quantum interpretation.

Douglas Hofstadter has a few interesting words to say about <&quot;>holism<&quot;> and <&quot;>reductionism<&quot;> in *G√∂del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid*, a book which talks a bit about the interactions between machines and consciousness and whether the human mind is essentially a machine. In principle, every thought you have is the result of a denumerable finite sequence of neurons, their states, their firing rates, information about their interconnectedness, the plasticity of the synapses between them etc. But somewhere along the line *consciousness* appears as a result of this process. So far, we don't know why or how this happens, but we know that it happens for physical reasons. So, we place a <&quot;>black box<&quot;> somewhere between physical/chemical brain activity and thought and say that one induces the other in an explicable, but not necessarily denotable manner. This is an analogue of the correspondence principle and, again, you've a lot of climbing to do before you even reach the barest cognitive information from the underlying chemistry.

What we understand so far is that consciousness doesn't have a place in the brain, like speech, memory, etc. All of these aspects work in unison to create a phenomenon that acts independently of it's parts. 

This is called an emergent property of complex systems. 

You see it in climate, ecosystems, life, as well as certain phenomenon like tornadoes, hurricanes, whirlpools. 

The philosophical basis of modern network theory, as well as the conclusions of the organismic scientists just before the microscope revolution of biology, refutes the assumption of descartes' mechanistic thinking: that we can understand the whole by dissecting the parts. Rather, life and consciousness, these properties emerge out of the relationship between the parts, and not out of any single one.

So as neurologists and the brain, and biologists\zoologists with bodily systems, we can understand the mechanisms used to create the life or consciousness, but we can't understand the essence of what those mechanisms collaborate to create. 

To dissect a frog, you have to kill it first. How can you understand the life of a frog by killing it?

Just as mechanisms of the brain form consciousness, and the parts of the body work together to crerate life. That particular form of life is nested in a larger network of emergent properties, which work together to create an eco-system. 

This same functions on the microscopic, atomic, and subatomic level too. As you go further down, you see that each of these 'parts' is nothing more than a vaccuum if seperated from it's larger 'cosm.' 

There are lots of good writers on this topic, I like Frijtof Capra's <&quot;>The Web of Life.<&quot;> It gives a thorough, historical, introduction to these concepts.

Instead, I'm going to make a suggestion for how you can expand your horizons without the knee-jerk <&quot;>That's wrong<&quot;> reaction. 

When you read a philosophical work, don't think too hard about the conclusion at first. Seriously. You can almost ignore it entirely in many cases. 

**Step 1: Interpret.** The first thing you want to do is nail down all the definitions the author is using. Philosophers love to make up words or redefine existing ones, so first you need to figure out exactly what they're trying to say. Sometimes you'll find that they haven't defined their key terms at all (or use two definitions of the same word in different situations). 

**Step 2: Outline.** List every step of their argument. Include all the assumptions and/or presuppositions they've made, propositions, premises, inferences, and conclusions. If you know your logic, try to use the right notation. 

**Step 3: Analyze.** Look at the structure of the argument and determine the validity of their argument. If it seems valid, look at the assumptions, presuppostions and premises and try to tell if they're true, plausible, implausible, or false. Then you can make a judgement on how sound the argument is.

*Now* you can look at the conclusion and say what (if anything) is wrong with it. It's usually some combination of: the author uses ambiguous language to herd us along, the logic doesn't hold water, or some premise is false so the rest doesn't follow. If you can't find anything wrong with the argument, BOOM! Horizons expanded.

What I like about this methodology is that it either gives me a specific reason to reject some idea, or it forces me to open my mind to the possibility of it being true (even if I'm not entirely convinced). 

I highly recommend you start with your own views (if you haven't already).",,null,null,,0.073,0.86,0.067,-0.3299,6,2,7,17,45,30,31,59,105

Saying that abortion is both 'right' and 'wrong' is not the same as saying A=/=A, it's short-hand for a whole raft of emotional, logical and principled responses to the different experiences different people of either side of the argument have had, embedded in any number of different moral frameworks. You can't draw a complete set of moral and aesthetic conclusions from the starting premise that reality is objective. Ayn Rand's stance on any given issue owed far more to her experiences in Soviet Russia and the series of 'existentialist' philosophers that came before her, than it did to deductive logic.

But reading Marx probably isn't the best cure. Marx was to the worker what Rand was to the capitalist: both only consider the contribution that their preferred social class made to scoiety, and ignored everything else. Try Gary Cox's [How to be an Existentialist](http://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Existentialist-Making-Excuses/dp/1441139877) for an easy intro into the philosophy Rand most obviously borrows from (consciously or not). Then look up Michael Huemer and [Ethical Intuitionism](http://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Intuitionism-Michael-Huemer/dp/0230573746/): he argues that (a) contrary to popular opinion, most people actually share the same set of moral principles (morality is *kind of* objective), and (b) we should be prepared to act against those principles when there are strong utilitarian arguments in favour of doing so (eg, telling lies in order to save lives) - also see David Friedman's [Machinery of Freedom](http://daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf), where he makes a strong case for the same. These are arguments that Rand never really considered in her writing.

Finally, the best cure I found for bad philosophy was to take other subjects. Take economics: you learn how to trade off competing utilitarian arguments against your own morals, and you get a shedload of solid consequentialist evidence for the free market system. If you want to expose yourself to the other side of the political spectrum, development and labour econ are full of strong (and view-changing) arguments for state-intervention. And if you really want to know the nature of objective reality, take a course in statistics and read Bryan Greene's [Elegant Universe](http://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Universe-Superstrings-Dimensions-Ultimate/dp/0375708111/) - objectivity is a tricky concept, and arguably John Galt should have known better.

Do these and then come back to Ayn Rand. You'll see that she was a strong intellectual, but her philosophical framework is a dud and extremely limiting if you're trying to form a world-view. There is a LOT of information in the world which can't be derived from her starting premises, and you'd be quite a bit happier for exploring some of it.",1,c977amz,null,,0.068,0.848,0.084,0.7543,5,5,3,16,39,47,26,98,128

They seek to create a major life change.

They assume you are ignorant of something far more fundamental.

Is it silly to assume I haven't heard of Nacho Cheese Doritos? Maybe. Is it insulting? No.

The insinuation that I haven't given a moment's thought to where my food comes from, or the salvation of my eternal soul is an entirely different matter. This assumes that I am uncivilized, ignorant, and uneducated. Certainly you see the difference.

There is a third thing. Would I bother a perfect stranger with a Brand X to Brand Y switch? No. Not unsolicited. But not for fear of offending them. It doesn't matter in the long run, so it's a terrible example to use here.

Most people know about Christianity, but most people do not study it and wouldn't know everything there is to know about Christianity. For Christians to hope to convert, they have to assume that others haven't considered everything.

I disagree.

Use of animals for food accounts for the vast majority of animal suffering and exploitation.

It's very easy for most people in Western societies to eat less meat or to give up animal products, reducing demand and driving production down.

It is also the single most effective thing people can do to help the environment, way before switching to a hybdrid.  Livestock production is causing massive environmental damage.

And I won't even go into the health benefits of eating less animal products.

Now all of that can be freely done by individual members of society... who will naturally respond to what other free individual members of society do and say.  *In other words: to proselytization.*

And if you are preachy on top of that, you will be converting other people to preachy, people-converting vegans.  In other words, you will be contagious.

If the conversion rate is sufficient, the whole society will exponentially go vegan.

However, it's like another person already pointed out: if you saw someone doing something you thought would only end badly, would you not go out of your way to try to stop what was happening?

There's another view, too. There are many people out there looking for help, looking for comfort, for support, for someone who will listen and not run away. They say, <&quot;>God, if You're out there, send me a sign.<&quot;> Christians proselytize to help those people, to be that sign, and to save lives as well as souls. We welcome everyone, and rarely turn down a plea for help. If you come across a Christian who won't help, they're not being very Christ-like.

I had a friend in college who used to get beyond angry when Christian groups would leave flyers on his windshield. In that kind of outreach, people are just casting a wide net to get the word out. I would tell my friend - and every type of proselytizing falls under this - it's just an advertisement, it's really nothing to get upset over. It's like a commercial. You don't have to accept, you don't even have to listen, they're just giving you an option, letting you know they're out there if you want to join. It's not rude, it's advertisement.

If necessary, use words.<&quot;> Note that when others tell me that they're not interested, I listen and carry on with the next person.

Now, iPods are clearly dominant as far as MP3(4 technically) go. No real competition, but its becoming an out of date product. That's fine. That happens.

But let's take a look at Apple's rivals first. Judging by one of your other posts, Google is clearly the one you'd favor. I mean, what's not to love? Dangerously open platform known as Android, check. (I call it dangerously open, in a joking way- there's not significant danger but the main benefit of a more closed system that you lament is security). Cheap? Ooooh yea. So-wait, why is it so cheap in the first place?

See, here's the difference between Google, and Apple and Microsoft. Apple and Microsoft sell you a product. Google doesn't do that, not for all practical purposes. They make money through advertising. You're the product. Just like Facebook. But they're *a lot* better at it. A lot. Google business model is essentially Big Brother on steroids. They want information. They want you going to them to look for information, so they get information on what you're searching for. That's why android is cheaper than it should be, because its free. Because its just another way to get you connected.

Now whether or not your ok with this, as I suspect most in actually are, you have to admit its certainly at least more devious than Apple's <&quot;>here's our product, go buy it<&quot;> model.

Alright, now what about Microsoft? Well for one thing, remember a decade ago Microsoft was everyone's favorite company to hate on. It had anti-business practices (which Google and Apple have for the most part, miraculously avoided *somehow*), it was everyone's cruel overlord, and made its market dominance make Android's look like child's play. Now Microsoft is playing catch-up, trying to rapidly adopt Apple's business model. Ie. The surface, creating its own....hardware.

Hardware. That's a difference between Google and Microsoft, and Apple. Apple, does hardware. For the most part until recently the same wasn't true for Google and Microsoft (Google has its terrible Chromebooks that will never sell and Microsoft has its surface which was a blunder, but appears to be picking up steam). Hardware, and software. That's not an easy combo. Especially, since, well manufacturing tends to lead some questionable business practices (cheap labor) (Foxconn though has worked on their reputation recently). Its tough. But does that make them a horrible company? No. It makes them a company. Making normal decisions. These decisions maybe aren't wonderful, but they're not comparatively horrible.

It should be noted that both Google and Microsoft have taken cues from Apple it seems- Microsoft with the Surface and Google with acquiring Motorola. Because even though hardware and software isn't easy, it gives you control over a product (although in Microsoft's case its to give a better product, in Google's its to leverage Android power away from manufacturer Samsung).

Overall, I don't think Apple seems to be any worse than either of its main competitors as far as business practices go.

Are Apple's products overpriced? In a word, yes. But, they're overpriced in the same way a Rolex watch is. Its a luxury brand, in a sense. And while that means its fair to say you should never buy it, I don't think that makes it a horrible company. I wouldn't say Rolex is, would you?

Finally, Apple has done some incredible innovation in the past, and isn't done it for the future. Remember, the iPod was an incredible innovation. The iPhone brought in smart phones. And its reportedly working on an Apple watch which bring it to a fight with Google Glass in all likelyhood as <&quot;>wearable tech<&quot;> (personally, I think I actually prefer the watch knowing virtually nothing about it. Google Glass seems a bit obnoxious to use (<&quot;>Hey, Glass!<&quot;>) and I don't want to wear glasses all the time. A watch seems a bit more convenient and could probably be more powerful).

I'm not going to say Apple is a <&quot;>Good<&quot;> Company. Not many of those exist. But its not a horrible company either. It's just a company. Just like Google. Just like Microsoft. Just like 90% of the rest.",1,c8mquo9,null,,0.11,0.76,0.13,0.8188,17,10,15,27,145,148,59,160,190

Consider for a moment that the word <&quot;>smartphone<&quot;> did not exist until very recently.  Cell phones existed, sure, but they were a portable version of the standard telephone (ignoring texting for a moment).  Nobody at the time linked the utility of a computer and internet connection to a phone.  A phone had a very specific purpose, that being direct communication, and nothing else.  Apple changed this perspective with the original iPhone.  This product was subject to a lot of parody at the time, with people joking <&quot;>I'll point my iPhone at it and it'll zap the problem away!<&quot;>.  In how many instances today can such a device do just that when it comes to finding your way to a restaurant, local attractions, accessing the internet on the run, or even posting on this very website?

I agree with you.

I'll explain why the best course of action is to totally remove the Government from every aspect of providing health care:

First off, back in the 18-19 century, [healthcare was much more affordable and accessible.](http://www.freenation.org/a/f12l3.html) People essentially got healthcare through 'lodge practices,' that catered to different demographics.

Most of the information below I copy/pasted from [this post over here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/198ufs/so_i_dont_really_understand_why_healthcare_is_so/c8luz3r) by /u/lifeishowitis.

**Third party payer system**: Most healthcare is provided through employment which was created to entice employees when their was a federal cap on wages during the Depression. When someone else is paying a lot of the cost, you are less likely to discriminate on prices. This also applies to government provided health care. When people can compete, then prices become lower. Look at what's happened to Lasik Eye Surgery and Plastic Surgeons over the years; costs have continued to fall.

**American Medical Association**: This is a board of people already involved in the medical community who get to decide how many doctors are to be available. Through the AMA and other licensing requirements, they can get artificially high price for their services by restricting supply through this monopoly. Get rid of the AMA, which would increase the supply of doctors, thus decreasing costs. I'd rather a review system similar to Yelp! than having a bureaucratic AMA in charge.

**Tort Reform**: Getting hospital procedures have risks, and you shouldn't be able to sue for $10 Million if a procedure doesn't go right. You should get compensated for damages, but get the Trial lawyers out of it.

**IP**: Because of IP, there is a lack of competition in the pharmaceutical industry; once someone has a patent on a drug, they can stop other people from producing it, again getting an artificially high price for a product by restricting supply through a monopoly.

**FDA Regulations**: This is yet another way that Pharma and other medical device producers have restricted supply. By creating insanely high barriers to entry in the field, smaller companies are unable to create opportunities for themselves which would help to break up the large companies.

**Health insurance industry**: These guys are mandated to cover risks which should be pretty uninsurable. That is, we should have incredibly different premiums, plans and co-pays for those of us who are big risks, including but not limited to someone such as myself who is a smoker. Instead, all of the people who make better health choices are insuring my risky behavior which drives up the cost to them, brings down the cost to me and does nothing to mitigate my poor decision making. This lack of incentive to make bad decisions so that one can pay reasonable prices for insurance can help lead to worse choices than would otherwise be the case. While you could be denied for <&quot;>pre-existing conditions<&quot;> you cannot be discriminated against for behaviors that will necessarily lead to these eventual pre-existing conditions.

**Lack of Profit Signal**: I think well under 1/4 of the hospitals in the US are for-profit, if I remember correctly. This means that on top of all of this other regulation, a <&quot;>price system<&quot;> is lacking pretty severely in the production and distribution of the products and services that hospitals provide.

**From Catastrophic to Routine**: Generally speaking, insurance is used to cover the cost of a <&quot;>catastrophic<&quot;> event. In car insurance, this is for crashes. In life insurance, this is for the eventual death of a person. In health insurance, we don't use this principle. We use insurance for everything. Check-up? Insurance company. This creates artificial demand for insurance, driving the price up and creating an insane amount of bureaucracy, driving the price up more. There is also lobbying to make it mandatory for insurance companies to cover things that are neither catastrophic or routine, like massage therapy, hair implants, and oddly, ovarian cancer in males.

As an example, look at these doctors who don't accept insurance. This one charges his patients [$38/month](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/your-money/dealing-with-doctors-who-accept-only-cash.html?pagewanted=all). 

**Administration costs**: Think about how many people who work at hospitals that just bill all day. They don't provide any services, yet have to get paid. Or the Hospital CEOs who get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars per year without seeing any patients. Remove that waste, and you can easily charge [$50/visit, like this doctor.](http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-204_162-610269.html)

[Here's another good article.](https://mises.org/daily/4434)

Solving the problem is easy: get the Government out of every facet of this industry, and we'll all be able to afford healthcare.

It's taken off my salary before I even get it though, so I'm unsure about the actual amount. As far as I'm concerned, it's income tax.

You post is very well written, but misses the point IMO.

&gt;Third party payer system

This is a good point, but unfortunately it doesn't work that way. When the government has full power over which drug it subsidizes, the drug company start to compete for the favor of having the subsidized drug, which then will have a fairly guaranteed market,  and will be mass produced. This drives quality up, and cost down. It also leads to corruption problems, but these are present with any company lobying unfortunately. If you make individual people pay for their treatment, while they will be able to choose more easily which one they want, they will also not be able to pressure the companies as much, thus leading to higher prices.

&gt;Tort Reform

I agree on that point, and actually, in France, there are a lot fewer cases like this. But this has nothing to do with single-payer insurance, and a lot more to do with the justice system, and how entitled people feel.

&gt;IP

While I do feel that IP in the drug business should be treated as a special case, as it can save lives, we need to remember that IP is there to protect the investment drug companies make in order to get a product released. India has nice ideas regarding drug related IP : IIRC, they will force drug companies to license their production to local companies, driving down cost and enabling employment, while still giving some of the profits back to the original company.

&gt;FDA Regulation

Do you seriously think it's a bad thing that new drugs are very thoroughly tested before being sold ?

&gt;Health insurance industry

While I agree with you on principle, with the advances in genetics I'm not sure it's a good idea to have health insurance that can know every aspect of your potential health before determining its price for you. We already have found genes that increase the risks of cancer, for exemple. If you had to submit a genetic checkup before being able to apply, you could have individual not being able to afford insurance, even though they might never get sick, on the off-chance that their gene gets activated at some point. You could also say that homosexuals have a higher overall chance of getting AIDS, and because of that, they should pay an increased rate. At what point does it stop being common sense, and becomes discrimination ?

&gt;Lack of Profit Signal

Why is it bad that hospital are not operating for profit ? I'm pretty happy that the hospital around me are not trying to make ends meet, or they would prioritize the most rentable procedures over the most urgent ones.

&gt;From Catastrophic to Routine

This is a good point, but unfortunately, our body is not a car and there is almost no body-maintenance that you can do yourself, and almost no diagnostic that you can do either. It's far from being as simple as <&quot;>My tire blew, need to change it<&quot;>. And furthermore, not having check-up covered would mean people wouldn't get check-ups, which would lead to higher death toll from malignant diseases, which would be caught in a later stage. And for the $38/month doctor, it's a lot. I pay &lt;80$ a month for coverage from EVERYTHING, not just my GP.

&gt;Administration costs

It's delusional to think medical cost are driven high by the administrative staff, when you see the price of the machines and drugs used. Furthermore, I'm pretty happy there is an Hospital CEO, and people who do the management jobs the doctors don't have time to do.

I disagree, based on the fact that people should be able to have a choice, especially since most drugs have a narrow therapeutic window, which means that 1 drug may not work for lots of people. This is why we have so many cholesterol drugs, for example. Drugs are mainly expensive due to patent laws that allow for hoarding of patents.

&gt; While I do feel that IP in the drug business....

I do agree that this is a contentious issue. I'm not exactly sure what the best way to handle it is.

&gt; Do you seriously think it's a bad thing that new drugs are very thoroughly tested before being sold ?

Yes. I think this function could be handled by a privately run entity, [similar to how Underwriter's Laboratory assesses electronic products](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UL_%28safety_organization%29). Why should something that drug companies should pay for be subsidized by taxpayers?) Another problem with the FDA is that it restricts potential drugs from being used in <&quot;>last resort<&quot;> cases, which may have a possibility of helping patients with no other options, or at least contributing to the amount of research available.

&gt; While I agree with you on principle....

Insurance wouldn't be based on genetics, as you said, there's too many variables. Plus, the risk would be spread over a large group of people, so individual characteristics may not contribute to price as much. Insurance would be used totally different too. For example, let's say I save up $10,000. Well, instead of having a high priced insurance start at $2,000, I could instead buy lower priced insurance that kicks in after I spend $10,000. As I save more, my insurance would go down, as I would be able to pay for more of my medical needs myself. This puts more power in each individuals hands, and gives less money to the insurance company, while also encouraging saving for future crises.

&gt; Why is it bad that hospital are not operating for profit ?

A lot of these jobs are bullshit make-work jobs though. For example, Michele Obama worked at the University of Chicago Hospital system as a Vice President for Community and External Affairs. She made $360,000/year. Of course, she only got that job because her husband became a Senator, so that the hospital could get over $1 Million in tax-payer funds.

&gt;Yes. I think this function could be...

I'm unsure how it's done by the US, but in France, companies will pay for the testing of their drugs, and then their report will be checked by (hopefully) neutral government entities. Usually, drug testing is done by specialized subcontractors. The FDA-equivalent can also order more testing, or testing by a different contractor before giving its authorization. For the last resort thing, it doesn't quite work that way usually. Drugs are refused if they fail to show an improvement to health bigger than their common side-effects. As an exemple of very last-resort drugs that are used everywhere, see pretty much anything used in Chemotherapy. They are nasty, nasty stuff.

&gt;Insurance wouldn't be based...

First off, this means insurance would be cheaper for rich people ?! That contradicts the idea of an equal right to health coverage. Furthemore, it also means that if a drunk guy rams your car, with you in it, you might have just lost your life savings.

I don't know for the US, but in France, the government is still more neutral than companies. In the few cases it's not, everyone flips their shit (The french are good at that.).

&gt;Yes. Insurance may be cheaper for rich people...

Because they won't get rich by saving 80$ a month (on something that should be a basic human right). And while 80$/month is a hefty sum for very poor people, you have to take into account the money they'll make back every time they need a check-up or to buy drugs.

&gt;There would still be charity hospitals. I also imagine Interns and Fellowship residents will need access to patients.

Are you arguing for a better level of care for richer people ? I just can't get behind that...

&gt;Yes. I think people are rational.

You do ?! Vaccines are government backed, and people are (irrationally) going against them. Pretty much every vodoo medecines techniques (from homeopathy to acupuncture) has never been backed by the gov, and people are buying into them. People don't have the education to make the decisions they have to make when it comes to health, and they'll defer that decision to someone else. When it's a (usually government backed) doctor, it's ok. If they go with some freelance dude, more often than not they'll get treated badly.

&gt;Government is a corrupt entity.

I mostly agree, but I do think that it's still less corrupt than companies (at least in France). Furthermore, as pretty much anyone important in the gov is elected, if they do a bad job, the People can just not re-elect them. With companies, good luck trying to fire Apple's CEO because you disagree about the way they treat their chinese workers.

&gt;All of those companies were started prior to those countries having Universal Health Care. 

This is simply not true. Sanofi was created in 1973, Aventis in 1999, Novartis in 1996, GSK in 2000, etc... (Full disclosure, some were created out of the fusion of older entities, but they could have changed domiciliation if the US was the paradise you speak of)

&gt;For example, Sanofi employs 28,000 people in France, but employs 110,000 globally.

Of course they'll go global, why not ? But what is way more interesting is to compare those numbers in proportion of the population of the area considered. They have 25% of their employees in a country with 60M inhabitants (.8% of the world's population), and 75% in the rest of the world. See of that works ? Furthermore, there is a Sanofi R&amp;D center next to the lab I worked in in Lyon (which definitely is in France), which was built in the last 10 years, and is huge and well equipped (had the occasion to visit).

&gt;Almost every new (i.e. recent) pharmaceutical company has been started in the US. 

Where is your proof ? I personally know people that started biotech companies in France, and I actually am going to do exactly that next year. Yeah, the language I used was coarse, but seriously, you have not backed-up every claim with sources at all. 

EDIT : For the cracks part : I agree that their is a lot we should do to improve the system. As said before, the system costs more money (to the taxpayer) than it should. But I'm honestly fine paying an extra through taxes to ensure equal, affordable and non-discriminatory healthcare for everyone.

EDIT2 : For more proof (http://www.genopole.fr/-Entreprises-du-portefeuille-.html) here is a list of 75 biotech companies that were created on the Genopole site, which was itself created in 1998.

I think pharma companies are becoming so big *because* of all the government intervention in the marketplace, especially price-fixing, which helps pharma companies out at the expense of consumers.

Pharma companies, [especially after they lobbied the Government to force Medicare to not bargain for better drug prices,](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/presenting-greatest-roi-opportunity-ever) get a huge 77,000% return on their investment in Lobbying. 

There really is no way to know what the market would look like absent Government intervention. Maybe instead of several large biotech firms (who gain efficiencies from having less regulatory staff, for example) there would be several hundred. Maybe instead of 75 biotech firms that started in France, there would be 400. Or their could be zero, if people wanted to take one last vacation instead of paying $100,000 for cancer treatment that may not work.

&gt; Are you arguing for a better level of care for richer people ? I just can't get behind that...

Sort of, but let me explain. All early adopters pay more. When LASIK eye surgery first came out, it cost $10,000. But competition rose, prices fell, and now it can be had for less than $1,000. Same with computers. They used to cost the equivalent of $10,000 or more (in today's dollars), and now can fit in your pocket for less than $100. DaVinci Surgical Robots currently cost over $1 Million. In the future, they might be cheap for enough for every hospital to have several.

&gt; You do ?! Vaccines are government backed, and people are (irrationally) going against them.

I think this is because people have insurance which covers any follow up costs, instead of having to pay for it themselves. If these people had to pay for getting sick, then they'd be more likely to pay for the vaccines in the first place.

I agree completely that there is a problem with lobbying, which has health related consequences in the case of the pharmaceutical industry. However, in France, we have very very strict laws about what kind of gifts a politician can receive. For exemple, our last president, Mr. Sarkozy, is on trial for receiving too much money from L'Oreal heir during his 2007 campaign. Anyway, I don't think this is an issue about single-payer system, it's an issue with unregulated lobbying, and personal greed.

&gt;Sort of, but let me explain...

It still means that rich people will get better treatment, since they will have access to the latest technology/drugs/advances. I can't get behind this at all. And yes, universal healthcare costs a ton of money, but I would be interested to see how much we make back by increased productivity and creativity, since people are healthier on average, and do not have to worry about health insurance issues. Honestly, even if it lost money, I would still back the system, as you have not successfully proven that other systems can be non-discriminatory.

&gt;I think this is because people...

Is it though ? In France, virtually nobody is against vaccines, while we all have complete coverage. In the US, there is a craze leading to polio re-emerging, and these people don't all have access to insurance. And your argument is basically <&quot;>People start to think when they have to spend their money<&quot;>. I think we both know a lot of people who spend their money completely irrationally, so the argument doesn't stand.

&gt;CEOs have a much higher turnover rate than elected officials...

While this is probably true, CEOs can be fired by the owners of a company, while politicians can be fired by pretty much everyone, as long as there is a consensus that they suck.

The first thing is to say that what you put forward here is a pretty picture, but unfortunately not reality.  Health care availability (or affordability) in the US is appalling for low income families, they are very much NOT the paragon's of health your argument makes them out to be.

This is only possible because of massive government involvement.  Saying that more government involvement is going to up the price for the end-user is a bit of a non-starter.  If the government is involved they can decide what poor people pay, as they are interested in how the entirety of society is performing.

They are in control of the entire chain, meaning the can make decisions based on impact on the entire chain.

The point worth making is that the government has an interest in people staying healthy, not just for those people's sake, but for the rest of society. Although this is quite vague, everyone has an interest in as many people as possible within the same society to be healthy also. For example, if you were the last healthy person in the world because of going to checkups, your life would be impossible anyway, as everyone else is ill or dead). 

That means that the attitude that it's people's own responsibility to handle this is not productive: *But that's a risk that people should make for themselves.

Or so they can continue to steal tax revenue from citizens who live longer. But often times, with Governments, the interest in cronyism is *higher* than the interest in keeping people healthy.

&gt; This is because those people being ill (although caused by their own stupidity) STILL harms society as a whole. 

And here's what I hope is my 'coup de grace' of the healthcare argument. Rather than have people pay for insurance upfront, which obscures costs, causes prices to rise, causes insurance companies to become rich at the expense of everyone else, and all those other things I've mentioned, how about this:

* Instead of healthcare insurance, why not just allow people to pay healthcare bills? So in the above scenario, someone could save up $10,000, plus have insurance for something catastrophic (the one-in-a-million $1 Million cancer bill), which insurance would cover.

* But, what about a $5,000 knee surgery (or whatever). Instead of having that person pay cash, they can choose to pay it back over time. For poorer people, this may mean paying $1/month forever. For richer people, this may mean paying $50/month, which is still less than most people pay for insurance. This way, the hospital keeps all the money, instead of giving it to insurance companies.

* This allows people to shop around, while still paying for the procedure afterwards, instead of before. They can check out Yelp Reviews for the fairest hospital, ones with the best doctors for the price, etc. Hell, with smart phones, people will have time to decide which hospital they need to go to on the way to the hospital. Or, have a hospital picked out ahead of time based on prior research.

* It also still allows for charity hospitals for poor people to go to.

* A lot of what you're talking about goes back to education. It's wrong to think that all poor people are stupid. Most are just in an unfortunate situation in their lives. But if they had better education (separate issue) then perhaps they'd be better able to understand the risks/benefits associated with getting preventative care.

I also think that total bankruptcy of the entire healthcare system due to Government mis-allocation and mismanagement is a far greater threat to <&quot;>society<&quot;> than any single poor person not having access due to no Government programs being available. We already have $16 Trillion in debt, [and potentially $86 Trillion in unfunded liabilities.](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323353204578127374039087636.html) We can't keep spending this much on medicare, [or the entire Government will go bankrupt.](http://www.american.com/archive/2007/march-april-magazine-contents/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-medicare-but-were-too-confused-to-ask) Then again, i am an agorist and voluntarist, so if Government were to collapse, i would be quite over joyed.",,null,null,,0.177,0.694,0.129,-0.9859,6,9,34,14,95,67,36,90,201

Sure it does.

* It gives them an incentive to shop around for medical care, since it's their money, and not the States or insurance companies.

* It gives them an incentive to eat healthier. Most poor people are overweight/obese (mostly due to USDA subsidies for shitty food (yet another Government issue; The Rabbit Hole of Government Waste of resources goes quite deep...))

&gt; Sign me up for that! I agree that is a reasonable system...

This only works if you get rid of the AMA, increase the # of doctors, and get rid of other government restrictions that make healthcare so expensive (like the other articles I linked to on this thread and the other one I'm currently engaged in). Hospitals would likely have 0% interest loans (no inflation to worry about), and would likely be able to right off losses against gains, thus maintaining non-profit status while still working for a profit. Only like 1% of medical bills are outrageously expensive. Most procedures will go down in price over time as technology improves and competition for patients widens.

&gt; All irrelevant if it's unaffordable to being with. 

Without the State, healthcare will be so cheap it'll be unrecognizable. All those $10,000 bills charge like $200 for aspirin and shit like that.

Totally respect that. I'm interested as well.

&gt; I'm not convinced that going back to the 18th and 19th centuries is the answer to providing high quality health care.

It was certainly high quality back then, with regards to the available knowledge/technology at the time. It's a difficult comparison to make, so I understand if you don't accept it. But there were plenty of medical innovations during this time period (I'll update later when I find a link, I knew I saved one somewhere....)

&gt; My understanding of the AMA is not that they control the supply of doctors, though I'm willing to concede they control the standards by which doctors are permitted to practice.

This is true, but they also restrict that supply to far too few people. Thousands of students apply to medical school every year. Some of them should be able to enter into degree programs that allow them to practice certain skills. For example, in a large city, 1 person could likely make a successful practice of only diagnosing certain ailments/diseases. By changing up the model of how we administer medicine, there could be vast time/money savers involved. Rather than going to school for 12 years to diagnose/treat thousands of different conditions, you could have people specialize in a much shorter time period. 

The AMA also restricts the number of Medical Schools, which further restricts supply in regards to the population.

&gt; Health insurance industry: Spreading risk, not concentrating it, is the most effective cost-sharing plan, no? 

For crazy expensive diseases, yes. For routine procedures, no. I can expand on it further, but I think the analogy I used above is quite sufficient. With regards to border states, we'd be better off implementing Migration instead of Immigration, and also end the War on Drugs, which is a separate issue.

&gt; Profit signal: Profit is not the only positive outcome for judging a system. Remember that health care is a human right (at least IMHO) and, regardless, healthy people is a social good.

Totally agree. But profit is a signal to producers as to what to charge people based on market conditions. Not saying that Hospitals should only care about profit; far from it. But by giving patients what they need at a price they can afford, it leads to systems that are sustainable, and if resources are correctly distributed, profitable. I'm for non-profits (like St. Judes) and other models of providing services. However, a common misconception is that for-profit means more expensive. Often times, [like in the case of this hospital in Oklahoma,](http://reason.com/reasontv/2012/11/15/the-obamacare-revolt-oklahoma-doctors-fi) it means charging less and reducing costs in other ways in order to beat your competitors, thus charging less, while still earning a profit which can be invested back into the business, or used to pay for people who are less fortunate.

After all, a single payer system is just doing the same thing. They're moving profit from one procedure/patient to another. The difference arises due to the lack of competition, and thus poorer and less innovative services.

&gt; Admin costs: it's unclear to me that government regulation either causes or can cure CEO pay, whether in a single-payer system or otherwise.

This is technically ''outside<&quot;> of the healthcare debate, but one of the main contributing factors to the rise in CEO pay was the laws the Government created which stated that all CEOs had to disclose their annual income. As well as other tax laws that were supposed to curtail the rise in CEO pay, but in effect did exactly the opposite.",,null,null,,0.073,0.773,0.154,0.9955,12,7,25,27,129,123,38,92,217

Consider incentives for innovation. Single-payer systems have low overall cost because the government will only pay a lower cost than would result via the free market. But imagine if when cell phones were invented, the government ensured cheap, universal access to them via a <&quot;>single-payer-cell-phone-plan<&quot;> that would only pay cell phone providers a very low price for each cell phone. Do you still think Apple, Google, RIM, etc. would have invested their money in making the smart phones we have today? The most important part of health care is that we will continue to find new and better ways to cure, prevent, and treat problems. Mandating very low prices for health care will drastically slow our progress on that front.

There's also cost introduced any time insurance is involved in a purchase. When you buy anything, you are basically paying the cost of the labor to provide the good or service you are buying. You have car insurance to cover cases where cost would be shockingly high. But what if, when you want to get an oil change or fill up your gas tank, that purchase had to be made via your insurance (regardless of if it's public or private)? Don't you think it'd be more expensive? You wouldn't just pay for the oil or gas, you're also now having to pay the price of having people work the insurance side. So cost-wise, it's best to only have insurance for catastrophic events.

So I think part of the problem is we are over-using insurance for health care. One alternative is to only mandate or provide health insurance that covers emergency, high-cost, catastrophic health issues. For more regular health care needs, we could have mandated [HSAs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_savings_account), with subsidies for people under certain incomes. That makes sure they have the money for most health care needs without the overhead of any insurance, whether public or private. The catastrophic insurance we provide (whether public or private) would be at lower cost because it would be responsible for covering far less things. It could have a high deductible, but the amount of that deductible could be the same amount that is guaranteed for everyone's mandated/provided HSA.

The above approach hasn't been used very much (I think Singapore is the only example). So I wouldn't be comfortable with just switching our whole nation to it. But there are reasons to be hopeful that it'd be much better, in balancing cost and incentives for innovation, than our current system or a single-payer system. So I think, in the US, this is a great opportunity to use our different states to test ideas. At the federal level, maybe we could provide block grants to each state along with a mandate that every citizen must have a certain level of access to health care. Then different states would be free to provide the care however they think best, and over time we could compare what really works. Some states could go single-payer (Vermont is already doing this), and some could try the HSA+catastrophic-insurance approach.

As far as the administrative stuff, some of the admin jobs will still need to be done - making sure supplies are stocked, etc. But a lot of the admin costs in the health care system right now, as I understand it, relate to the existence of multiple insurance plans with different coverage and payment options, and about a zillion different means of handling payments. Seems to me that single-payer would clear a lot of that up - things either are covered or they're not (elective rhinoplasty, for example), and the payment gets billed to one place, and then the money comes in from that place.

I'm extremely interested in any more info you - or others - can provide about Singapore. I've thought about that as a possible system, but ended up discarding it as overly complex (see previous paragraph about admin overhead). Perhaps Singapore has cracked that nut?

You think that if the government pays for healthcare for the people, everyone will get the care they need at rates they can afford. There are several potential problems that must be dealt with. To start, it would require taxpayers to increase the amount they pay in taxes, which most people don't want to do. Healthcare is expensive and no amount of rearrangement of the government's budget can make up this cost. 

Probably the biggest issue is the quality. If all of the sudden everyone could afford health care, people will start to go to the doctor for preventative care more often. At the moment, most physicians work 50-60 hours a week. In order to accommodate the influx of patients, there will need to be more primary care physicians and possibly fewer demand for more highly paid specialties. So one one front, doctors will be pushed into lesser pay. 

Then you get into the issue of the government paying for things. Medicare and Medicaid are known to reimburse health care services at below market rates. As a physician or any other health care professional for that matter, would you fill your limited time with patients who will pay you $100, or those that will pay you $90 (simplified example)?

Re: government paying at lower rates - the government does pay doctors and hospitals lower rates, but it also pays for prescription drugs at higher rates. And if there's a single payer, there's only one customer, right? So if doctors want to be doctors, they have to take the pay. (Corollary: If the customer wants doctors, it has to pay a reasonable rate. So there would likely be a readjustment in prices paid, but even with lower prices, there would be more customers, so possibly more revenue?) Again, good thought-experiment info, but is there data?

This is pretty intuitive if you think about it; if I think I have something wrong with me that might kill me I'm going to see a doctor whether I pay directly (through insurance co-payments) or indirectly (through taxation). Most countries with universal healthcare don't cover dental work properly for exactly this reason.

In the province I live in, we have government controlled health care but private insurance covering common medication, eye and dental care. Not everything is covered under government health care. As an example, sex reassignment surgery is covered but dental isn't. I'm not saying one is more important than the other for the well being of a person, but there're guidelines and systems in place to decide this, and it changes once in a while.

Here are some of the problems we face:

Wait times: too many patients, not enough hospital space. In fact, so much so people go to the United States for privately paid procedures.

Brain drain: the money is better elsewhere, also in the United States. 

Some family doctors have stopped taking new patients because they've reached capacity, and also because the number of doctors retiring are outnumbering the new doctors entering practice.

Government budget cuts mean more things are being taken out of coverage. Eye exams was the last thing people made a fuss about.  We also have to pay a surcharge to be in the system now; it used to be included with our regular income/property taxes. 

Personally, I don't really have a problem with private and public coexisting, but I also understand it's harsh. Obviously people want better and more timely care, but the service providers also want to make more money. The biggest argument against having private and public together is creating a two tiered system (bad word here) because now you're not advocating equal care for all. The <&quot;>best<&quot;> people goes into the private system, and people who pay get the better care.  The rest of us mere mortals are stuck with whatever we can get.

Never mind the situations where doctors scam the system by pretending to see patients, so much so the government is wasting money to randomly calling up patients to verify the claims.  Never mind the smokers, drug addicts and people who live unhealthy life styles who will need more care later in life. Never mind the government's ability to get into scandals regarding kickbacks dealing with health care, like an online healthcare management system or hospital helicopter services. There are plenty of problems to be looked at in the system already. If i understand correctly, you can also get insurance that can get you semi private hospital rooms in case you need to stay. I need to look this up. Maybe it's only in certain situations, like giving birth or something, but it's like, you pay more, you get more. Which is already not what equal health care is all about.

To be honest, I think the idea of universal healthcare is a good one. I just don't think there's been a good implementation of it yet. I'm really happy to see a discussion on it that hasn't devolved to people yelling about political agenda or pandering to the public for the sake of votes.",,null,null,,0.076,0.736,0.188,0.9965,11,13,28,16,75,66,32,68,141

* High quality care is by definition unequal care, in order to ensure that a person who suffers a catastrophic event gets the best care that person must consume more raw resources than a healthy person over their entire life span. Is that just/fair to all parties? 

* The more a single program has to deal with, the more complicated it has to be. The complexity increases at an exponential rate whereas real coverage increases arithmetically. If a single program is to handle all health problems in all parts of the country it has to be well more complex with much higher overhead than smaller programs designed to handle smaller regions or specific problem. Wouldn't it be better to support programs of a similar size to already existent programs elsewhere than to create one that has to deal with far more in the way of diseconomies of scale?

* Large organizations have a problem with customized care. There is a reason small companies and organizations are almost always better at customer service than large ones, namely that listening and responding personally takes a lot of time and money. Smaller groups can delegate this time and resources in an ad hoc manner without risking losing individual cases, large groups have to respond in a bureaucratic manner or be sure to lose individuals. The problem is that standardized care isn't effective, otherwise we would already be automating the jobs of doctors and nurses. A single, large healthcare system would have to chose between losing people because of lapses in paperwork or losing people because standard practice was ineffective.

* High costs of procedures aren't being caused by a private-market. Without addressing the root causes of inflated prices (high drug costs, frivolous lawsuits without a meaningful pay cap, runaway hospital overhead) then significant savings would not be realized a change in the system. Where would the gain in efficiency to provide more overall health care come from?

* Health care still needs to be rationed. Nothing is ever free. The money for health care would then come from tax receipts, but tax revenue is finite. Is health care a better investment than education or an expansion of transit infrastructure? Is it better to let some people die without care in order to ensure better care for others, or to pay for other programs like NASA, DARPA, or scholarships?

Now possession in their most basic for are things that are created through mixing ones knowledge and labor with resources to create something. In a modern sense we typically see this in the form of wages becoming possessions through direct sale of ones knowledge/labor or through selling something that you created through your own knowledge and labor.

Now we consider these things the possession of the creator because he has the highest claim to his creation. If my neighbor builds a shed, it is not rightfully mine to use or take because I have no proper claim to its ownership. this can only be achieved then by force or coercion.

Likewise when inheritance is passed down no one has a higher claim to these possessions than the proper owner who should be able to sell or give them away as he sees fit. The only way to stop a voluntary transaction such as this would be to use force or coercion to take the items away. In simple terms taking money away from them will at some point require a loaded gun being pointed at the proper own.

I, as do most non-sociopaths, believe that initiating force or using coercion is inherently wrong. That is I can't just walk up to someone and point a gun at them and demand money, but if someone were to do that to me I would be justified in using equal force (pointing a gun back) to protect myself. Further I believe it is no different whether it is an individual holding the gun or a 'government' because governments are comprised of individuals. Because, as I previously stated, this requires the use of force and coercion I consider it no different that theft at gunpoint.

owning something means you have the highest <&quot;>claim<&quot;> to its possession. Passing down things you own is a voluntary action.

There is still much we don't know about these events and processes, but we know enough about them to say they *can* happen without any intelligent design.  That is, intelligent design isn't necessary for life to exist.  But you state that your biggest issue is probabilistic.

Over extremely long periods of time, events with vanishingly small probabilities of occurrence will almost surely happen.  We have a vague understanding of how life can form from inorganic material and we have a very long time horizon.  Combined that doesn't make life so unlikely.

From a more philosophical point of view, inserting an intelligent designer into the mix just begs the question of how the designer was formed.  Was there nothing, and then out of nothing sprang a designer, and then the designer decided to create the universe, and then create life?  Has the designer simply always exists? It seems that every question you have about the creation of the universe that is answered by the existence of a designer can then be asked about the creation of the designer.

&amp;#8710;

that makes sense about the time frame, but I have a few issues on that. Another redditor above used an example of a trillion-sided dice earlier, so I'll use that some.

let's say you have a trillion-sided-dice with one possible outcome that is the original form of life on earth (I would assume evolution says this is some sort of amoeba or something):

* how often does that dice get rolled?
* Who rolls it?
* and every time some slight change comes to that form of life, some advancement if you will, that dice has to be rolled again.
* if the dice is rolled again after landing on that spot, how much of a chance is there that that dice lands on a spot that allows that single-celled organism to procreate, or even survive more than a single roll of the dice?

I'd like to avoid the philosophical and religious discussion for right now, but my basic assumption on any form of intelligent designer is that for it to be real, it would need to be a part of the fabric of the, for lack of a better word, multiverse. It would need to have existed before our universe and either have died off at a certain point or currently exist beyond the realm of our current observable universe. This is not exactly logical, but it is the best I have for now.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Earth_hypothesis

Life forming in early earth wouldn't be so much someone rolling a die, but more like a die rolling around a shaking bowl.  It's bouncing around, landing of different sides, at some varying rate.  And it's not just one die, it's millions of dice, all bouncing off each other.  If one of them lands the right way, boom, there's life.  If you believe in the <&quot;>many-worlds interpretation<&quot;> you would believe that in many alternative <&quot;>worlds<&quot;> exist following every possible <&quot;>random<&quot;> path.  Within that paradigm, we exist on one world where life formed at a certain time in a certain place, and in other worlds it developed differently, or perhaps not at all.  

By asking <&quot;>who rolls it,<&quot;> you've entered back into the philosophical <&quot;>prime mover<&quot;> question described by Aristotle.  That get traced back to the big bang, but if I recall correctly, it's literally impossible to get any information from before the Big Bang because the singularity encompassed all spacetime.  The word <&quot;>before<&quot;> no longer makes sense when spacetime is compressed into a singularity.

Also, as a quick aside, nothing can ever be <&quot;>proven by science.<&quot;>  Science is based on inductive reasoning.  We see some pattern, and from that we extrapolate consistent and parsimonious models to explain it.  Only within the axiomatic world of mathematics can anything be proven, since math uses deductive reasoning.  We can become increasingly confidence in our scientific models with lots of data, that is, after lots of induction, but nothing is ever proven.

This is a very good point, and to be honest, I'd never heard the counter-argument to the watchmaker analogy. However, I have a counter-criticism, if you will. The criticism in that article gives an example of a snowflake and a crystal generation as something that was orderly that was created in nature. however, this is a small example of something *within* the world that is orderly. Here's an example. Let's say this <&quot;>watch<&quot;> (a snowflake) was created by a machine (the world). That original machine would have had to have come from somewhere, maybe even another machine, but that other machine would have had to have come from somewhere, and so on and so forth.

This is my biggest issue with those who believe evolution, even down to Darwin himself. They observe something small in the world, and apply it universally. Darwin observed microevolution, which is a wonderful part of nature, but from that, he concluded macroevolution must be fact. You can't take one little part of the universe and generalize it into everything. That's like saying <&quot;>that man is a genius, so all people must be geniuses<&quot;>, or even a real-world application we see every day: <&quot;>that man lives in a poor neighborhood and he committed a crime, so you should be wary of poor people, they're criminals<&quot;>

My point is the whole process of moving from micro-evolution into the theory of macro-evolution is a logical fallacy. And feel free to correct me if I'm wrong about that.

 

I know there is no evidence a supreme being exists. I'm not arguing for a supreme being that currently exists, or anything involved in there being a supreme being, that, to me, is a totally separate discussion. This is about the idea of everything happening by accident being absurd to me.

 

Actually the odds of even a single particle occurring are outrageously higher than that, and that's saying that matter would arrange itself in the way that it did, not that matter came out of nowhere. To my knowledge, no matter has ever been created ex nihilo, even by the greatest minds on earth, let alone by accident.

We can only observe a limited amount of points with a limited amount of detail and accuracy. At some point we have to interpolate and extrapolate.

To pick up on your example: We find that a man that lives in a poor neighborhood commits a crime. Then we find an other. And an other.
After some observation, we find that 10 men out of 100 in a poor neighborhood commit crimes, while only 2 out of 100 in a rich neighborhood commit crimes. 
At what point are we able to conclude that there is a correlation between poverty and crime? Is observing 1 man enough? 100? All of them?

What ever way we choose to determine how many are enough, two things are obvious: 1 is not enough and observing *every* man is unreasonable. If this wouldn't be the case, there would be no way to draw any conclusion

In the case of evolution, we have a lot of data.
* We observed what you call micro evolution countless times. 
* We know that a species can change gradually over multiple generation due to random mutation and natural selection.
* We've found countless fossils that show a development from one species to an other.
* We've even predicted what kind of fossils we'll find where.

Every time we find a new point of data, it fits right in to our previously predicted model. Sure, there are gaps, but how many points that fit the model do we have to find to say <&quot;>yep, our model is probably correct<&quot;>.

Lastly, in an other post, you said that evolution isn't science, because we can't directly observe it over millions of years. If that were the case, almost none of our disciplines of science would be science. History, archeology, astronomy all study the effects of something that we didn't observe directly. In almost all fields, we can only observe the effects and not the causes.

Generally bad reporting and layperson speculation, really. From a biologist's standpoint...<&quot;>missing link<&quot;> to what? We already have plenty of data on human and primate evolution, including now-extinct hominid species. Even if through some freak accident they get excited about a discovery that turns out to be a red herring, eventually someone's going to DNA/Isotope/etc test it and realize the error.

The pig bone was an intentional hoax (Piltdown man) and it was scientists themselves who realized the issue and pointed it out. This is how it works. From the beginning, people in the field were suspicious, since it didn't really make sense considering every previous discovery. It only lasted so long with any measure of apparent authenticity because of the lack of sophistication (in terms of technology, procedure, and accumulated knowledge) in the field up to that point. 

&gt;I have heard several times that charles darwin renounced his theories on his deathbed, because of a lack of evidence, namely these missing links. Is this true, and what have you all to say of that?

The missing link thing seems to be a misunderstanding that's really common among laypeople, since it's easy to imagine species as these discrete <&quot;>kinds<&quot;> of being. In reality, they're more like a continuum of phenotypical traits, with a population that's similar enough to each other. As they evolve, organisms do not spontaneously <&quot;>become<&quot;> something else. On a population-level, they just gradually accumulate small changes from past typical populations until eventually they're distinct. 

Regarding Darwin renouncing it on his deathbed: There's no evidence that he'd done so and it would be pretty out of character considering his work even later in life.

Even if he **did** renounce it, he'd just be wrong. He doesn't represent evolution in any way other than being the guy to work out the dominant mechanism. He's not really a figurehead or any equivalent to a religious figure.

&gt; My point is the whole process of moving from micro-evolution into the theory of macro-evolution is a logical fallacy. And feel free to correct me if I'm wrong about that.

I think I can offer some insight on the macro- vs. micro-evolution cognitive dissonance that you seem to have. Suppose we define micro-evolution as being characterised as the accumulation of genetic or epigenetic differences between parents and their offspring (restricting to sexual reproduction for each of discussion). And that we do so recursively and laterally, so that the micro-evolution between a grandparent and a child is the union of the micro-evolution between the child and the intermediate ancestor and that ancestor and the grandparent. Let's do something similarly obvious for siblings, cousins and all other familial relations that we normally discuss.

Macro-evolution, conversely, we can define in terms of speciation or sexual incompatibility (whether two organisms can breed or not is an oft-used measure of whether something is in the same species as another---there are nuances to consider in terms of sexual compatibility; as far as I know, there are species that will preferentially not mate with organisms of a specific other species but *can* still mate with them. We'll subsume this relation into sexual incompatibility). There is said to be macro-evolution between two species, connected through ancestry, if they are not able to breed.

Here's the trouble. Almost all fertile sexual organisms are able to mate with their parents. What does this entail for what we've set up? Well, let's suppose we have a chain of ancestry between me and some ancestor that is of a different species, as one might posit in light of evolution. I can breed with the parent of mine that is of the opposite gender and so we are <&quot;>of the same species<&quot;>. That parent can breed with one of their parents and so they are <&quot;>of the same species<&quot;>, and so on. For most uses, we use R(x, y) = <&quot;>x is of the same species of y<&quot;> as an equivalence relation. <&quot;>x is of the same species of x<&quot;> is always true. <&quot;>x is of the same species of y<&quot;> implies <&quot;>y is of the same species of x<&quot;> is always true. <&quot;>x is of the same species of y<&quot;> and <&quot;>y is of the same species of z<&quot;> together imply that <&quot;>x is of the same species of z<&quot;>. It would seem then, that I am of the same species of any of my ancestors, even if they're not hominid. (Richard Dawkins once said <&quot;>Your 185 Millionth Great Grandfather Was A Fish<&quot;>, a phrase that, as you can imagine, was subject to great misinterpretation to argue that evolution was an indefensible theory).

 The point is that, if every organism that ever existed were alive today the concept of a *species* based on sexual compatibility would seem very inconsistent hand-in-hand with a relationship between micro- and macro-evolution, if we consider such-and-such a species as a set of organisms. For if we are all related via micro-evolution (an ancestor relation) then if we choose a species---a set---then something outside that set must be related to something inside that set by a primitive familial relation (parenthood or childhood). For if it weren't, we are assuming that they are connected by an extended familial relation like siblinghood or grandparenthood, etc. Any intermediary must fall inside the species or outside the species. If the relation between the inside-the-species and outside-the-species thing is primitive, then they can interbreed and thus they must both be inside the species. If the relation is not primitive, then traverse the chain until you come to a point where you move from inside the species to outside the species via a primitive relation. The thing outside must become inside by the above argument. Recursively, we can draw everything into the species, by moving along the train and <&quot;>dragging stuff in<&quot;> until we reach the organism we chose on the outside. So everything must be of the same species!

This is an argument that I think is analogous to that which staunch opponents of evolution put forth as a reason why evolution is indefensible and that micro-evolution cannot lead to macro-evolution. We'll call it the <&quot;>My grandfather is not a fish<&quot;> argument: that a denumerable sequence of micro-evolutionary changes can never amount to a macro-evolutionary change.

The problem with seeing this as inconsistent is related to a paradox about <&quot;>vague<&quot;> predicates called [the sorites (or heap) paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox). Suppose I have a heap of sand. It has a finite number of grains of sand in it, as expected. For most people, it is reasonable to say <&quot;>taking a single grain of sand from a heap preserves the *heapness* of the heap<&quot;>. Removing a drop from the ocean, after all, preserves its <&quot;>oceanness<&quot;>. However, after removing a finite number of grains of sand from the heap can yield 0, 1, 2 or 3 grains of sand, say. But each single removal transforms a heap to a heap (if not, then which removal changes the <&quot;>heap<&quot;> into <&quot;>not a heap<&quot;>: the one that leaves 808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,
710,757,005,754,368,000,000,000 grains of sand remaining? Or the one that leaves 808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,
710,757,005,754,368,000,000,001 grains?). The resolution to this paradox is that <&quot;>heapness<&quot;> is a vague predicate. It is a heuristic. So is the concept of species. It is not troublesome to say, identically <&quot;>Transition from parent to child, sibling to sibling, and so on, vaguely preserves the concept of species<&quot;> and <&quot;>Recursively following a chain of these events can lead us into another species<&quot;>. It's as easy to say as <&quot;>Generally speaking, adding 1 to a small positive number yields a small positive number<&quot;> and <&quot;>There are big numbers<&quot;>, because the concept of big is vague.

Now, of course, I haven't given you much support of the theory of evolution. My intention was to address the specific point I delineated above and show, vaguely, that <&quot;>a denumerable sequence of transitions, each of which does not change any properties, can, in fact, change properties<&quot;>.

What do you count as observation in this context? Do you expect a fish lineage to gradually turn into birds in, say, the less than the 150 years for which evolution has been a theory? No one posits that as a possibility. Evolution takes time. Similarly, if you're expecting it to be possible to move <&quot;>continuously<&quot;> along from a bird to a fish through intermediaries, that's quite impossible since most species that have ever existed are extinct.

So what do we look for as evidence? Fossils, certainly. [Genetic adaptation to fit a purpose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment). Drastic changes in the genome of an organism like whole genome duplication events. Someone else commented about how we can construct near-identical phylogenetic trees through a variety of different methods. We can see that genetic conservation is stronger between closer branches of this tree than further branches. Homology in gene sequences. There is so much evidence that supports and is supported by evolution.

&gt; I was more rejecting evolution along the lines of anything more than a subfamily.

Who imposes these barriers between species that you so adamantly insist conserve only the idea of micro-evolution? That the building blocks of genes are uniform across different species guarantee that we can move from the genome of one species to another with germline deletions, insertions, duplication events, mutations. If you give me the genome of one organism, I can apply a finite sequence of these steps to transform it into that of any other organism. It can be shown that these steps happen *in vivo*. What precludes these steps happening in sequence to transform one organism into another? They happen all of the time. We see somatic and germline mutations between parents and children constantly. The fact that the more beneficial mutations are preferentially selected for speeds this process up by *guiding* it.

The evidence supporting evolution transcends dozens of fields of scientific study, and it unites observations from all of those fields into a coherent model of reality. There is a reason evolution is one of the unifying theories of biology. Evolution is so fundamental to biology that it could be argued that biology doesn't make sense without it, in the same way that geology doesn't make sense without plate tectonics, or chemistry doesn't make sense without atomic theory. Not only is it one of the most heavily supported theories in all of science, it has explanatory power that transcends several fields of scientific study. 

Evolution is taught in schools because it is supported by evidence that is gathered through observation and testing that are consistent with scientific procedure. In contrast, intelligent design has no evidence, and it's unclear if it can even be tested. If it has no evidence in its favor, and it can't be tested, then it doesn't belong in a science class. And in addition to that, it's just bad logic. <&quot;>We don't know how X happened, therefore we know how X happened<&quot;>?.

Kind of a long documentary, but [Judgement Day: Intelligent Design On Trial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2xyrel-2vI) might interest you, as it explains why intelligent design is not taught in classrooms in the United States.

&gt;my issue with cosmology is with the <&quot;>ex nihilo<&quot;> problem...where did everything come from, as it is most definitely a scientific fact that, due to rates of decay and whatnot, the universe has not always been.

First, it's not a scientific fact that the universe has not always been, though it is a scientific fact that the universe has not always been the way it is now. We can only see so far into the history of our universe before we can't see any further, because there was no light in the beginning of the universe for us to see. We don't know that the universe was <&quot;>created<&quot;> ex nihilo. The universe may have always existed, but it may go through multiple phases of existence. Also, [virtual particles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle) do exhibit ex nihilo like behavior, in the sense that they pop in and out of existence. Some physicists believe that all energy in the universe may have resulted from virtual particles popping into existence. The big issue with that hypothesis is the breaking of symmetry.

But just like with intelligent design, if cosmological intelligent design has no evidence in its favor, and it can't be tested, then it doesn't belong in a science class. And in addition to that, it's just bad logic. <&quot;>We don't know how X happened, therefore we know how X happened<&quot;>?.

Again, kind of a long video, but I think [this is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRn-mVPIl60) that explains why intelligent design can't explain <&quot;>ex nihilo<&quot;> creation. I apologize if that's the wrong video.

&gt;These are taught as being scientific fact, however, they have never been observed, and by definition, for something to be proven by science, it must be observed.

In order for something to be science, it must be supported by evidence and logic. Direct observation isn't necessary for science, otherwise black holes wouldn't be science either. <&quot;>Observation<&quot;> in science just means that we can detect its influence on reality. We may not be able to observe black holes directly, but we can observe their effects on things that we can directly observe, and black holes are consistent with the laws of physics that we've distilled from observations of the universe. And it seems a bit odd for you to say that something must be observed to be proven by science, yet you use the big bang theory, which cannot be directly observed, as evidence that the universe has not always existed, at least not in its present state.

In addition to this, evolution can be observed. Evolution is merely the change in the frequency of traits within a population. All you have to do is get a dozen or so members of a species with a short breeding cycle, expose them to selective pressure, and watch the frequency of traits change. Scientists can do this with bacteria, insects, mice, and plants. Scientists have even introduced species to isolated islands, and, over the course of just a few decades, have observed these animals evolve and diverge into different species. We do this artificially with all domesticated plants and animals. Poodles and bananas aren't found in nature. They were selectively bred into their current states, and the principles that allow such changes to occur are the same ones that govern evolution by natural selection, except instead of humans doing the selecting, it's the environment, hence <&quot;>natural<&quot;> selection. The basic governing principles of evolution are heredity, mutation/recombination, and selection. All of these are observable. Evolution by natural selection is merely the interaction between those principles.

The chances of reality being exactly the way it is, regardless of whether it was <&quot;>random<&quot;> or created, are very tiny. But if you roll a bazillion-sided die, you are guaranteed to get a result than only has a 1-in-bazillion chance of happening.

I know claim your argument is logically based, but unfortunately you are wrong.  <&quot;>The sheer size and complexity<&quot;> of the universe exponentially *increases* the odds that even the most unlikely of things would happen.

Also, evolution by natural selection is a scientific fact.  It can and has been documented not only in living organisms (check out the book **The Beak of the Finch**), but  we can see evidence in things like fossil records, vestigial organs, convergent evolution (when unrelated species fill a similar ecological niche and evolve to have similar traits), divergent evolution (when closely related species are forced apart into different niches and evolve distinct traits).

There are no <&quot;>placeholder<&quot;> explanations that scientists use until a better explanation is developed. All scientific explanations must stand on their own evidence, not the lack of evidence for other explanations.

If you want to show that ID is a scientific explanation, then here is how you would do it. 1) Think of an observation that is predicted by ID, but not predicted by any other theory, 2) Try to discover that observation. If you can discover that observation, then you have evidence in favor of ID. The problem with ID is that it doesn't predict any observations, thus there can be no evidence in its favor. And because it makes no predictions, it's not falsifiable either, which is an essential element of any scientific explanation. The only observation that ID predicts is a lack of understanding on the part of scientists, which is not evidence that ID is true. All arguments in favor of ID can be reduced to <&quot;>We don't know how X happened, therefore we know how X happened<&quot;>, which isn't just unscientific, it's also illogical.

&gt;ID is just another method of interpreting this data

If by <&quot;>another method<&quot;> you mean <&quot;>non-scientific method<&quot;>, then this only strengthens the argument that ID shouldn't be taught in science classrooms. If you say that ID is just another way to interpret the data, then ID, as an interpretation, would add an unnecessary entity without adding more explanatory power, and it would lack falsifiability, which is an essential element of any scientific theory. In other words, it would be a much weaker explanation than evolution, and it wouldn't even be scientific.

[This is a list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Design#Scientific_criticism) of characteristics that are expected of any scientific theory. ID has none of them. The only way for ID, in its present form, to become a scientific theory is to change the definition of science. Until then, ID doesn't belong in science classes.

Science is a way of using verifiable observations and the implications of verifiable observations as a tool to separate things we know from things we don't know, as well as things that may be false from things that are definitely false, in order to acquire knowledge about the natural world.

Also, Yes, we cannot observe something that happened millions of years ago- but that in no way limits our confidence of an event actually happening.

Let's take the analogy of a robbery. You've been away from you home for weeks, having a lovely vacation in Bermuda. When you come home, your window is broken, your house is trashed and several of your belongings- especially the valuable ones are missing.
Obviously, someone came into your house. Despite not being there to see it, you can be fairly certain that is the case. Your belongings could have just up and disappeared, but there is still the more simple explanation that someone took it.

What's interesting about this robbery is that multiple other robberies occurred in several other nearby houses, all within the time frame of when you left. Even more interesting is that these robberies all occurred in a similar fashion- broken windows, valuables stolen, as well as numerous other peculiarities that tie these robberies together. Again, there exists the explanation that all of these valuables just up and left the houses, causing similar damages. Or, there's the ever more likely explanation that there was a robbery in each of these houses- with evidence building hat it was an repetitive process. Sadly, none of your neighbors saw who robbed their houses either.

You find little comfort in the explanation that a robbery occurred in numerous houses, especially since no one directly observed the culprit- if there ever was one. In fact, you doubt it was the actions of a culprit at all despite the similar crimes occurring in the same time frame- so you look for more evidence. You decide to examine the windows, how they broke or what broke them, you look for finger prints and foot prints. To your surprise, you're able to identify that all of the windows left glass on the inside of the house, indicating that if someone had been in your house, they got in by breaking into your window. You find foot prints that cannot be explained by the shoes typically worn in your house, and you find finger prints that belong to no one in your family. Your neighbors all report the same things. It's become incredibly easy to assume at this point there was indeed a robber in your house, yet you still doubt it.

You have a meeting with your neighbors. All of them complain about how their broken windows resulted in rain getting into their house. This sparks a bit of curiosity in you, so you decide to check when it last rained- as you live in a desert and rain is pretty fucking rare. Sure enough, it only rained on one day during the time you were gone. This means that the windows had to have been broken into prior to this date, otherwise the rain could not have gotten into the house. Another neighbor pipes up that he had a confirmed package delivery of a conspicuously marked box of gold bars left on his door step on a date prior to the rainstorm that was stolen. With this information- you developed a time line that places the instances of the robberies between the confirmed package delivery and the rainstorm.

More recently, you've heard reports on the news about how the instances of break ins is on the rise. Every single instance the houses were broken into using the same methods. Some people reported seeing a break-in occur. They saw this occur because they tracked down the single culprit using the evidence left behind from previous robberies. Sadly, they only saw the culprit leave the house with the TV, simply because they didn't stick around long enough to see what else would be taken.

I imagine after this much writing, it's becoming hard to see where I'm going with this. I'll stop rambling and get onto my point(s).

* Like the example of your belongings disappearing while you were away, evolution occurred while you were away- nonexistent really. Does this mean that we cannot be sure that it happened? Fuck yes we can be sure, there is so much evidence pointing towards evolution it's simply absurd to think otherwise.

* Much like how there was a rash of robberies (which is the name of a great state radio song everyone should listen to, but I digress), there are multiple instances of evolution. And, like how in the examples of robberies where different things were stolen through similar methods, evolution occurs in all species through similar mechanics. The things that were stolen in the examples are inherently different, as are the things that change through evolution- but the loss in the example and the changes resulting from evolution are all comparable.

* The fossil records used in evolution have a large number of conclusions based in large part by surrounding rock- there's a lot the surrounding rock can tell you. You can look at the material the surrounding rock is made out of and conclude that rocks of identical composition only form through sedimentation in river environments. This is highlighted in my example by how you found finger prints, foot prints, how the windows broke, etc. to be identical in each house. All of these identical pieces of evidence lend to the conclusion that the same things happened, in the same way.

* You can also age the rock through radiological dating, which allows you to determine the time that that sedimentation occurred. You can also identify significant ecological changes- like volcanoes, asteroids, floods, wildfires, etc. by the changes shown in the sedimentation layers. This is very similar to the dating method used in my example where you established a time frame around two known events.

* The point of all of that was to point out that even though you can't see the evolution of species occur, you can be sure it happened- just like you can't see the robbery of you house occur, but you can be sure it happened.

* There ARE contemporary reports of evolution occurring. It is becoming increasingly well documented in species of organisms with low generation times, and especially in viruses (which are excluded from the title of <&quot;>organism<&quot;>). Assuming there is no evidence of evolution is like assuming there are no robberies occurring in Belize. You're simply not hearing about it when it happens because you most likely wouldn't be interested in it every time it happens.

* There is no <&quot;>microevolution<&quot;> or <&quot;>macroevolution,<&quot;> as you seem to want to differentiate. Think of the example I used where the robber is observed stealing a TV. He was only observed taking one thing, due in large part to the witnesses only observing him for a short period of time. You cannot argue that a robbery didn't occur because only one thing was stolen, nor can you call it only a minor theft because the witnesses didn't see more taken. You can't say evolution is false because you have only observed small changes, nor can you say that it's only <&quot;>microevolution<&quot;> because you haven't stuck around long enough to see new phylums, kingsdoms, etc. appear. It is a robbery, no matter how little is stolen, as sure as it is evolution, no matter how few changes.

I can get you a link to a virtual lab that uses real world examples AND data from a study of the Stickleback fish that supports my points- if you want.

Quite frankly, you strike me as someone who fundamentally does not understand science. If we only considered things proven when observed in the manner you presume, then we wouldn't even have developed the wheel.",,null,null,,0.115,0.812,0.073,-0.9963,31,18,45,65,223,130,94,179,271

 I wondered if maybe you are more a deist? If that is something you could describe yourself easily with? 

About your problems with evolution: Evolution has in fact been observed many times under bacteria. This because using big animals would take way too long ( Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment) 

If this isn't convincing enough a lot of musea have fossils and you can maybe look at how birds came from dinosaurs and see the gradual changes over time in the species.

I also want to say that it is incredibly hard to <&quot;>prove<&quot;> things. I can't proof gravity exists. only that a pen falls when I drop it. If something would not fall this would mean my theory about gravity is false. 

About the odds : Atoms collide with each other really really fast. So it is in fact possible that some atoms collide with each other at random and form molecule X or molecule Y and Z collide and form X. This is because it happens well not infinite but close to a infinite times. 

So instead of looking at the odds as a big thing look at it like this: You have a dice and want to roll a six. If you roll one time the change of rolling a six is much smaller than if you roll the dice 10 times. 
Because the universe is so enormous and vast the dice is being thrown a bazillion times so it is more likely that it rolls a 6.

About the ex nihilo problem. I don't know what the problem is but I assume it is about what came before the big bang? If so the answer is we don't yet know. but because we don't know doesn't mean that god must be the answer it just means that god or whathaveyou is as good an answer as anything else.

I am sorry if some of this doesn't make sense. I am still a high school student and I am writing in a language not native to me.",,null,null,,0.071,0.89,0.039,-0.7512,4,9,8,13,39,28,34,31,77

My issues with evolution are not with adaptation to circumstances within a species, or even an order, but with the idea that evolution at some point caused creatures to cross these borders into a new form higher on the taxonomic ranking (such as humans evolving from monkeys or even more so that all living things evolved from a single celled organism).

Humans evolved from a ancestor we share with monkeys. this makes monkeys something like a cousin on the <&quot;>family tree<&quot;> of species. Another thing to understand is that Nature doesn't have a taxonomic ranking. It is as possible for ants to come out of a single cell organism as much as Humans can, and it doesn't just go from single cell organism to human there are thousands of steps and millions of years in between. 

And if you do believe that species can adapt to circumstances I don't understand your problem with evolution. An organism becomes another species if it is an isolated group of organisms long enough to change so much that it can't have fertile babies with the original species.

To me it seems like you are pretty much saying: I do believe that something can change. Just not that they can change so much that they can't have fertile babies with the original thing. Is that correct?",,null,null,,0.013,0.875,0.112,0.9332,4,1,6,4,37,26,25,26,46

Because I can point to large swaths of the world which are fairly peaceful right now: the wealthy parts. Some countries among them are even *sustainably* wealthy - that is to say, they don't need to exploit other nations or ravage the world to maintain themselves.

But in other parts of the world, many people have little to lose by picking up a gun and killing other people with it and, unsurprisingly, many people in those parts of the world do just that. Unless your definition of 'world peace' requires that there be no crime, that's probably what we should focus on.

I should note that right now, the number of nations in which violent conflict occurs has been decreasing for quite some time, so we're on a good overall trajectory. And overall economic development implies that most nations will have no problem eventually getting to a state where the residents have too much to lose to want to go to war.

Now, at present there are exceptions: imperialism, both condoned by nations (such as just about every war the US has been in for the past 100 years), and not condoned by nations (such as the conflicts surrounding 'blood diamonds' in which businesses stir up trouble for economic reasons), promise to suppress nations economically (and often politically as well) for as long as the imperialism continues.

But we're on a positive trajectory as far as imperialism goes, as well! A hundred years ago, multiple world powers were interfering with much of the world. Now only one and a halfish (China) are doing that, and far fewer nations are their targets.

We have little reason to think that things won't continue to improve towards world peace over the next, say, hundred years. I can't say when we'll see it... and I can't say that genetic engineering won't rise to prominence and we'll accidentally end up not human anymore before it happens... but I would say there's no reason to believe we can't do it sooner or later.

The socialist arguments are many but some of the most pervasive is how did they amass their wealth? Did they live off the land and hunt their way all alone for wealth eventually to become as rich as they are? Nope. They lived in a society made up of everyone where they used the schools, roads, health care just like everyone else. This is what allowed them to get the opportunity to even get as rich as they got. Which is why they should give something back. 

Another argument is simply results. Social democracy has worked wonders for the Nordic countries that are now on the top of pretty much every chart for the quality of life imaginable. Meanwhile studies are showing time after time that probably the most important aspect of a nation is the distribution of wealth, the bigger the gap the lower the quality of life (life expectancy, crime rate, overall happiness, you name it) *for everyone*, even the rich. 

Then there's the fact that the top 1% are actually paying a *far* smaller percentage than the average Joe. Warren Buffet (formerly the richest man in the world, now third) once famously stated that his tax rate was lower than his secretary's which thought was simply ridiculous. 

Honestly though a lot of it is sensationalism. I must admit that personally I fall for it but I can very well understand why not everyone does. That simply while there are people starving on the streets it's a bit douchy to bath in your champagne while fighting tooth and nail against every and any possible tax raise.

That said, there are certainly plenty of arguments as to why more affluent people would give more than less affluent people to charitable causes.

The obvious one is altruism &amp; empathy, of course. There's very little to be expanded upon there.

A more utilitarian approach is to consider that $10,000 to a super-rich person is worth less than $10,000 to someone less wealthy. Even $5 dollars to me is worth so much more to someone without much expendable income (or no income). Someone like Bill Gates (who's very charitable with his money---probably for this exact reason) will be impacted almost imperceptibly by losing denominations as large as tens of thousands, if not more, but the impact of that money goes up when given to someone for whom that denomination is still relatively big.

Most people who aren't rich (and some who are) seem to think that rich people are rich because they a) get all their money from their parents; b) are rotten, cheaty business people; c) are celebrities; or d) a combination of the above. I won't say those are never the case because as someone who has had to socialize with other rich people all my life, I can tell you many of these people are snooty fucking bastards who don't deserve anything they have.

However, a certain case of rich motherfucker who certainly deserves everything she has and more is my mom. My mom did indeed come from a rich family, but they haven't given her a penny since middle school. In high school she worked her ass off; she worked nights and weekends and made straight A's in school, and worked every fucking day during the summertime. With the money she made then and the scholarships, she put herself through college and medical school, where she also worked her ass off with a job and straight A's. Needless to say, she was very smart and handled her money well. Let me remind you that she did all this with no help of her parents‚Äîeven when she lived with them during part of college, they made her pay rent and bills, and kicked her out once when she couldn't pay up. They were harder on her than actual landlords. Even compared to how hard her parents made life in college, the real word wasn't any easier. This is because after (or during, I'm not sure) med school she married her first husband and moved to one of the worst financial places possible in America: Ft. Lauderdale. They weren't doing so well. My mom was exhausted as fuck working on completing her residency (ask any doctor, that is no easy feat) while her husband was basically just partying a lot and working *sometimes*. They divorced. Many many years later she was a doctor, doing not so well, as it was Ft. Lauderdale where the economy sucks and doctors aren't paid that well for doctors. She met my dad and they married and had me. He was the domestic one; he had a little travel business but didnt really bring in a lot of money. We were living in an apartment, then got kicked out because no money. We then stayed at my dad's friend's house, literally, Crazy Pete. He kicked us out because my mom left a lightbulb on, which was ridiculous because *she* was paying for the electricity. Crazy fucking Pete, man. I was three months old!  We lived on my dad's itsy bitsy sailboat for a while until we got sorta on our feet financially and got a place, which was in a pretty bad neighborhood. For roughly 9 years, I‚Äîa little girl‚Äîlived right next door to a registered sex offender who had been to prison for multiple counts of rape against little girls like me. It was bad, and i was extremely sheltered, but we had no other choice. Finally, my mom moved us to economically stable Texas, and now she, my dad and my little bro are living the good life while I'm in college working my ass off with naught a penny from her‚Äînot to worry, I had 8 good years of fancy living. 

While I personally do not wish for a much riches as I've had in the past, I am so damn proud of my mom for what she's done. She even stayed with my dad after they divorced so that my brother and I could have a parent there to raise us while she worked rather than a nanny (he lives in the guest room, it's a bit odd but it works).

This concept- that the rich must ensure that a certain level of poverty exists constantly- is a basic tenet of Marxism.   
        
Without a steady stream of impoverished labour, it becomes increasingly difficult to find workers to fulfill the myriad of mundane occupations that, when performed for the benefit of the upper class, free the wealthiest from the standard toils of subsistence living. Things like farming, mining, construction, waste disposal and energy maintenance are all the responsibility of lesser classes, but of which the wealthy benefit.   
       
This allows the wealthy to dedicate their time to whatever they desire, giving them a complete freedom of life direction.    
        
In order to maintain this freedom, the wealthy must ensure- varying from one society to the next- certain standards to the labour class that keep them relatively content enough to continue labouring in the best interests of the capitalist class. Depending on each society, failing to meet certain expected societal standards become unacceptable to allow en masse and in turn lead to the labour pool re-dedicating it's time towards resolving self interests. (Food shortages, illnesses, hostile environments, etc)    
      
In short, without the poor to do their work for them, the wealthy would lose the benefits of their class, and thus have a vested interest in maintaining standards deemed acceptable to the health and well being of the labour pool/impoverished.

&gt; I really don't understand how people can be willing to 'share' their partner with others in a romantic/sexual capacity.

What you're feeling is <&quot;>I don't see how *I* could be willing to...<&quot;> - and that's fine. You don't have to. You probably also don't see how people are willing to be in a relationship with someone you're not personally attracted to (like when you think someone is *super ugly*, but your friends fancy them just fine). And that's why everyone is different.

The thing is - some people choose to be poly, but some people just are. Just like some people choose to have a really healthy partner who does sports every day, but some other people can only ever be attracted to a fit and active partner. Neither is more <&quot;>valid<&quot;> than the other, they're both just fine.

&gt; Wouldn't there always be crippling issues with jealousy &amp; insecurity tearing at least some segments of the whole tangled relationship(s) apart?

Some people get super jealous, and other people don't. 

First of all, there's a difference between jealousy and envy. Jealousy means <&quot;>I have that and you have it too, and I want to be the only person that has it<&quot;>. Envy means <&quot;>You have that and I don't, I want to have it too<&quot;>. 

Envy can be healthy, because it makes people strive for new things. But jealousy is something that can be really good or really bad. Either way, it's something that can (and should) be openly talked about in any relationship. Especially in open relationships. It's not the end of the world if someone feels jealous, it's just a strong emotion that people can work through together. 

But if the romance is great, and harmonious, and sweet... then for many people, jealousy just doesn't even happen. Instead, we can feel compersion: joy at seeing the people we love happy. It's the feeling you get when a friend graduates or when your sis gets married or when a kid plays with a balloon. It's just really nice. Imagine having both of your girlfriends (or boyfriends) around the house at the same time, seeing them kiss and cuddle, and curling up on the sofa together for pizza and a movie. Or imagine going out on a date with a new person that you've just fallen in love with, and your wife (or husband) wishes you good luck, delighted that you've found someone sweet. Those are normal days in our lives. It's fantastic for us. 

Now let's say someone *does* really feel crippling jealousy at every turn. Sucks to be them, but still, it doesn't <&quot;>tear<&quot;> anything apart. It's just something we can talk about and figure out a solution for.

&gt; I feel like the exclusivity of the relationship would make their feelings for their one partner that much stronger/more meaningful.

Great! That's a good way to feel if it makes sense for you. You're happy being monogamous. Poly people don't want to convert you or make you feel otherwise. But we just don't feel the same way. We feel that sharing our love with multiple people makes our lives more meaningful, full of loving and caring people who don't set uncomfortable boundaries for each other. We're just happy this way. Some of us are wired for it, some of us choose poly as a lifestyle. And that's all good. :)

**Think of it this way... a flame that lights many candles burns brighter than a single candle, without losing its own strength.** For poly people, that's exactly how it is - we're not <&quot;>making up for something<&quot;>, we're just living our lives in a way that feels fundamentally *right* for us. We don't think that we're better than mono people, and we don't make sweeping statements on what's better or what's worse. We're just in love. :)

But to give you an analogy, I know that a homosexual relationship is probably not for me (as I've only ever been attracted to men), but is something that makes other people happy. I have no problem wrapping my mind around this - I could see myself being happy in such a relationship, because I can relate it to what I know.

I cannot say the same for polyamory. I am pretty sure I'd personally never be happy being poly, or being in a relationship with someone poly. I can't even imagine myself functioning healthily in such a relationship, because it's so different from anything I've ever known.

Intellectually though, from what you've told me, and from what I've read, I kind of do realise that with really good communication and consideration for everyone's feelings, it's possible for polyamory to work out, and even be beautiful.

I kind of hesitate to recommend fictional stories about polyamory, for one simple reason: every fictional story needs a conflict.

The way I see this, is that I don't <&quot;>own<&quot;> my partner. How can I <&quot;>share<&quot;> her? She is not my belonging. She is a person that I love, and enjoy spending time with.

In fact, she has a couple of friends who she sleeps with, who can provide her with (kinky) things that I cannot - at least, not consistently. I'm happy that she's doing this because it takes pressure off me to provide these things for her. I still try to offer her all the things she needs, but I can't do them in the *amounts* that she desires.

&gt;Wouldn't there always be crippling issues with jealousy &amp; insecurity tearing at least some segments of the whole tangled relationship(s) apart?

I don't really think so. In fact, I find being poly makes me less jealous and insecure. I, for the most part, know what (and who) my partner is doing, because she tells me. And again, she has the opportunity to leave me for someone better, but she doesn't because she loves me. When I was in monogamous relationships I felt insecure *all the time* because I felt I wasn't good enough for my partners. Now I rarely feel insecure at all, and when I do, all I need to do is ask my partner for a cuddle and some reassurance, and everything is okay.

&gt;I feel like it would be easier and simpler for two people in a monogamous relationship to communicate and deal with any issues

Well... yes, and no. I think that (experienced) poly relationships tend to take an extremely relaxed view on what is and isn't permitted - which is normally

a) Spend enough time with me and
b) Inform me of what you are doing and what you want to do

It's open, it's honest, and it's free. As I said before, it helps take the pressure off me to be her <&quot;>everything<&quot;>. It's actually really chill.

It is more complicated in that time is more constrained and you have more people's feelings to deal with. I'm not going to lie, it takes emotional maturity to pull off polyamory, and if you're inexperienced, you can very suddenly find yourself with a whole heap of insecurity to deal with. 

However, I think the transition from monogamy to polyamory is the difficult part. Once you become used to your partner being with other people, it becomes much easier emotionally.

&gt;and I feel like the exclusivity of the relationship would make their feelings for their one partner that much stronger/more meaningful. 

Based on what? I don't have any personal experience to draw from as I've never had more than one partner at a time before but it feels like you're jumping to conclusions here. 

After seeing one partner, you can see another, and appreciate them that much more.

I don't really see how being <&quot;>exclusive<&quot;> makes your feelings for your partner any stronger. If anything, it probably just adds to more resentment. How can you truly appreciate something if you have no point of comparison?

&gt;There also comes the practical issue of time, and someone with just one partner will have more quality time to spend with that partner.

Yeah, that's a thing. There is a limit to how many partners you can have, based on time and energy.

But, personally, I don't want to spend every waking moment of my life with the same person, anyway. I enjoy the time I have away from my partner, and then when I see her again, my heart flutters with excitement and joy.

If you were in a monogamous relationship, then to say this would be completely true.

I'm going to tell it to you straight: this is nothing but a myth, propagated by supporters of arranged marriage and the one-man-one-woman movement, in order to suppress anyone who didn't conform or follow the rules.

I am an Indian (South Asian) by birth, and back in India, arranged marriage is STILL the most popular option for young men and women everywhere. In fact, in my entire family -and this includes all the cousins I have who are just a bit older than me - of 3 aunts on my mom's side, an uncle on my dad's side, both sets of grandparents and all of my extended family, my parents are the ONLY ones to have a love marriage.

Let me just say that again. out of more than 50 people and 30 couples, only 1 of them has had a love marriage. See how this is a problem for newly married couples?

They have movies about romantic love, and society loves stories of star-crossed lovers, in order to reassure these people that they have made the right decision. It's a lot like [buyer's remorse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyer's_remorse): oh crap, why did I marry this person, I was so much better off, without them, etc etc....the older generation does their best to use propaganda and *especially* societal approval to convince them to stay married, especially in this age where the divorce rate has skyrocketed as people (mostly women) have become more independent.

However, most marriages like this are not mutual and so, they have not learned how to communicate, simply because they never had to. Women in particular just let themselves go because it their mind, they've done their duty and don't need to try anymore; it's basically like forced early retirement. Meanwhile, the father just works all day and doesn't take care of the children because it's not his duty; *he doesn't even know how to begin*. There is no desire to communicate, because these two people are basically strangers who are forced to live together and share the same bed because family and society told them they have to. And these people are touted as the model for romance and good communication? That's just bullshit.

___________________________________________________________

I know you probably live in a country with a more progressive views on marriage, but I just wanted to remind you that marrying for love is a VERY recent concept, and it is not practiced by much of the known world. Even in Canada and America, arranged marriages for political and business reasons were the norm until the late 1900s, and the woman (and man) themselves had no choice in the matter.

That being said, ALL poly-amorous relationships without exception are based on mutual love, desire, and most importantly, *good communication*. It is IMPOSSIBLE to have a relationship with multiple partners without complete openness of who those partners are, why you're meeting them, and how often you go. Otherwise, the primary partner wouldn't be able to deal with the stress and anxiety of their primary partner going out so frequently.

In a monogamous relationship, you're pretty much obligated to spend a lot of time with your partner, even if you don't want to and you're just not feeling like it. It's fine for couples who genuinely love each other, but keep in mind, this category of people are a minority in the known world. So naturally, these people grow to resent their partners for tying them down when they'd rather be out there having fun and doing the things they want to do. And let me tell you, a poly-amorous relationship offers a LOT more freedom than a monogamous one (though I probably don't need to tell you that) because you can go out with as many people as your mood or lifestyle allows, and you never have to stifle who you are just to be with someone else. And there is little question of hatred or resentment brewing either, because love, respect, and open and honest communication with your partner is VITAL to the existence of a poly-amorous relationship. Unlike monogamous relationships, it simply cannot exist otherwise. 

&gt; but on a more visceral level I truly don't understand how anyone could ever be happy like this.

I think this is true..for you. But there are many other people in the world, each with their own ideas, desires, and ambitions, which are vastly different from yours. If you understand this, then you should be able to accept that these people can happily live lives that you cannot even comprehend. In fact, you actually address this when you say

&gt; I've been doing a bit of reading on /r/polyamory[1] , and from the personal anecdotes shared, I can see that some people are truly happy living a lifestyle with multiple romantic partners, or having a partner who has multiple other partners 

I think this alone is the strongest argument to CYV- the fact that despite what you think, the majority of people in poly-amorous relationships LOVE who they are and what they do, and don't regret it for a second.

19e3q6,17,c8nlztd,c8nazvo,1.362104354E9,cimd09,,1,"I am of Indian background as well, and most of my family members have had arranged marriages. However, I think your view of arranged marriage is kind of archaic, and in this day and age, for most modern, educated Indians, it's completely different.

It's kind of like a parent-sanctioned dating service, where the choice to get married is still completely up to the potential bride &amp; groom. It's no longer two strangers forced to get married - they've been emailing, texting, chatting, calling, going on dates with each other, and have come to their decision. The only difference as I see it between arranged marriage and modern dating apart from the parents being on board from the beginning, is that the expectations of the boy and the girl and the level of committment are the same - both are going in looking for a potential spouse. In fact, I kind of like the straightforwardness of this - it's a lot less murky and confusing than modern dating.

In today's day and age, women are more independent, and men are more respectful of that, and I think both are more willing to work as a team when it comes to things like running a household and raising a family. Communication is all part of that, and I don't think many modern Indian women settle for less than that.

I would also say 'arranged marriage' and 'love marriage' need not be mutually exclusive. There is often a great deal of love in marriages that are arranged between two compatible people - it may not be all flames and fireworks (though I'm sure those can be present!), but those can burn out, and I think the love that gradually grows over time is far stronger.

In my family, the couples who were arranged are mostly very happy. There are a few who just do not go well together, and probably should never have married, true. Some of my cousins who had 'love marriages' are very happy. One of my aunts who had a 'love marriage' is miserable. It just varies from couple to couple, and I think it's unfair to say that the whole institution of arranged marriage (at least the way it's done among modern, educated Indians) is flawed.",,null,null,,0.044,0.829,0.127,0.9877,9,3,7,13,45,42,32,106,82

It's no longer two strangers forced to get married - they've been emailing, texting, chatting, calling, going on dates with each other, and have come to their decision.

 I would argue that this is so far from what arranged marriage used to be like that its not even arranged marriage anymore, which leads into my second paragraph. 

This is EXACTLY what modern dating is like, without the inclusion of parents making annoying suggestions. A relationship is a mutual agreement between two ADULTS. By letting parents take all the responsibility, you pretty much hand them the reins to your entire life. Which is fine, if you don't mind being treated like a child for the rest of your life. However, if you want to be an adult who takes responsibility for his own life and makes his own decisions, you are going to have to find the courage to take the reins back from your family and accept the consequences of your own actions. The failures hurt, but the victories are twice (if not more) as sweet because YOU achieved them YOURSELF.

(also, there's no guarantee that the process happens like you said. In my family and circle of friends, it's common to have marriages arranged between people when they're still children, or let them choose but not go through the dating process at all. I'd argue that the rocess is not really in the hands of the child because the parents of both parties are supervising everything. Again, it comes down to being treated like a child vs an independent adult. Hand-holding like this wouldn't happen in modern cultures with a modern mindset)

That being said, I think we can agree that people in poly relationships are more mature than people who go for arranged marriages, because not only do they have to love their partner and be very good at communication, but they ALSO have to make the decision as to whether its worth it or not by THEMSELVES, regardless of what their family thinks. This fosters a sense of independent thinking and self-confidence, which is vital if you are going to live as an independent adult in the modern era. It's also vital to poly rels because 9 times out of 10 the family will object if they find out, often quite furiously. 

Think about it. These people in poly rels...despite being ostracized by society and under pressure to change from their family and friends, not to mention the difficulties associated with having rel problems which most people don't understand, STILL decide, on their own no less, to stay together. Why could that possibly be?

The answer, of course, is love. Love keeps them together, even when one of the partners is out having fun (or fun sex) with someone new. Love keeps them together even when society and the media lambasts them for being freaks of nature (Fox news). Love keeps them together even through the disapproval of their family and friends who urge them to find a <&quot;>committed relationship<&quot;> as you call it. But most importantly, love is a powerful enough force to make these people WANT to succeed in their relationship despite all these difficulties, and that is the quality that the vast majority of monogamous relationships simply do not have; the fierce love and dedication required to pull through, and that is why the divorce rate is over 60% in America; because people have found they do not need to be in a committed relationship to be happy. And the thing is, neither do you.

If you're an Indian by birth (or have lived there), then you know a lot about your culture, so I won't bother explaining the little things. Basically, your life comes down to two stark choices:

1. Live a life of (relative) safety and security with your family, trusting that they will make all the important decisions for you with your best interests in mind, at the price of your personal freedoms as an adult, your desire to raise a family in your own way, your career path, and much of your control over your own life.

2. Declare yourself to be an independent adult and cut yourself off from them financially and emotionally (in the sense of a child depending on their parents) if possible. Get your own place, your own degree, and a job of your choosing, but with no guarantee that your future will be guaranteed or successful (in all honesty, it never really is). You give up security and take on financial burdens and the responsibility of your own life, but in return you have control and complete freedom over your own life to live how you want, work how you want, and do whatever you want wherever you want, limited only by your own imagination and self-imposed obligations (job, uni, money, etc).

Let me be clear: you can never have 1) and 2) at the same time. You know how overbearing and pushy Indian parents are, and grandparents are even worse. My mother would not let me go to the house of anyone she had not personally met until I was 18, and my grandmother still thinks that at 19 years old, I am still too young to be LEFT AT THE HOUSE ALONE for any period of time, let alone cooking and cleaning for myself. And my family is relatively liberal, considering that most of them have been to/stayed in the U.S.or Canada at some point in time.

That being said, I am NOT saying either option is the better choice. All i am saying is that for people like is, life is a tradeoff between security and independence. If you prefer security, and don't really mind your parents going ahead and choosing someone for you because maybe they're right and you couldn't do it on your own, then by all means choose option 1). 

But if you're like me, brought up in the West and have come to regard the constant attention from family members stifling, if not downright infuriating, and you're not interested in Commerce, Biology/Physics, or Engineering, and think that your path could be different, then I would suggest giving option 2) a try. You may meet with some (or a lot of) resistance from family members who expected you to <&quot;>carry on tradition<&quot;>, but if you truly believe in your own independence, then you can push aside their doubts, and your own, in order to take control of your own destiny. Yes, it's hard, and yes, you may make mistakes, but unlike option 1), it won't be too late to start over if you wake up one day and realize you've made a big mistake.

This is the choice you, and everyone else, have to make. Everyone in a  poly rel has had to make this choice, and all of them have chosen option 2) and have been a LOT happier than if they had gone with 1) and stayed in a committed relationship they didn't want. In fact, a lot of the people on this thread actually moved from option 1)  to 2) after they realized that 1) made them feel like a prisoner in their own lives, a side character in their own story. 

Whatever decision you decide to make, I hope you regret it. And remember, if you're ever stuck in a rut and have no way forward with 1), it is never too late in life to look up option 2). Good luck.",,null,null,,0.061,0.768,0.171,0.9995,29,10,33,45,177,161,77,253,314

I think it comes down to commitment: relatives have implicitly assumed a commitment to each other. People committed to you are a gift and should not be lightly cast aside. The commitment level with friends--that you might find much more enjoyable to hang out with--is generally much less clear, either because you haven't discussed it or because they already have their own commitments and would actually be unable to commit to you (making them unreliable for help). If the cost to maintain that committed relationship is to periodically spend some time with that family member, then it might be worth it.

I was the same as you, before, and I never spent much time with any of my family. Then, my little brother died (about 7 years ago), and the whole process of that is more insane than anyone can describe. I had family and friends who had passed away before, but never anyone as close as that. My brother and I lived one block away from each other for about a year and I think I went to his place about 3 times. You have no idea how badly I wish I had talked to him more, and seen him more. It would have been such an amazingly better use of my time than whatever else it was that I was doing; probably, usually, smoking pot or hanging out with some girl that isn't around anymore. When someone that close to you dies, it is impossible to even explain in words how drastic the effect is, of the thought of them simply 'not existing' anymore. The thought of someone so close to you being there one second, and gone the next. It really can happen like that with no warning. It truly is the most horrible thing.

Now, I try to at least talk to my parents every 2 weeks, if not visit. Any time other family is in town, I make sure to go see them. I do not spend every free moment of my time with them, but I am making an effort to get to know them all better. I think it will make us all feel better about it once any of us are gone. 

Additionally, I think this feeling multiplies once someone becomes a parent. With age, acceptance of the inevitability of death, and helping create the next generation, a person grows to value the time they have even with distant family, that much more. You start to understand how special the family bond can be and how cool shared traits and personalities are.

Is what most people are probably going to pick up on. I'm not religious, but I disagree with this comment. 

The ten commandments, are they not morals? Yes, you may say that God told Christians to follow them and therefore its not truly moral in the sense that it's not your own decision. But isn't *being* a Christian in itself a choice? Yes, beliefs can be influenced by parents, but this is no different when it comes to Atheism.

What makes us have morals? My answer to this would be experiences. Either that, or influential people in your life. Because (in the eyes of a christian) God is an influential figure, then that's one option in which the morals could be equal to the morals of an atheist.

Regarding this, I believe Christians do make better parents than atheists. Whether God is real or not, many dutiful Christians will act under accordance with the New Testaments laws, i.e love thy neighbour, do to others what you would have them do to you. Atheists  have many differing opinions of morals, and could simply be using atheism as a way to defend their views ('I don't think I should love my neighbour because I'm not Christian') - of course the same could be said of some Christians ('I shouldn't eat figs because Jesus said not to'), however those who I have met do not take the most of the Old Testament, and some other texts, literally, and see them as a either a metaphor or a romanticised version of what really happened. 

Being a Christian also instills a sense of service in you; being in a church community helps someone to be more open and involved in their society, and many charities like the Salvation Army and Red Cross were founded on Christian values, whether or not they follow those values today.

I also think that Christians would think more about morals than an atheist. Being Christian doesn't just involve you reading the bible and going to church.

Similarly, bad people will see an excuse to hate and fear in Christianity and use it.  And bad people will see an opportunity in Atheism to do whatever evil they want. 

It seems that people are moral (or not) for other reasons and manipulate their beliefs to fit around that.  I recommend reading some of Jonathan Haidt's empirical work on moral foundations.

You could say I ascribe more value to facts and openness to change.

Better, though? I don't think this can be attributed or generalized to a single group. There are many good and many bad people of all walks of life. Sure, religion is often used to justify bad actions, and atheism is not, but there are atheists that do bad things, even if not in the 'name of atheism' (which would be rather weird since atheism just means lack of belief in deities).

I am an atheist, and I am quite selfish, and certainly considered immoral by many religious moral codes (fine by me). I was the same way as a Christian, for the most part, though. I don't think the faith or lack thereof made a difference. It's just that while I was a Christian I had to ask forgiveness for my immorality, and now I do not view what I do as immoral anymore, so I no longer have to feel guilty or ask forgiveness from some external source. I gladly take the consequences of all my actions.

However, I suppose I'll agree with your point to this extent: Becoming an atheist did make me self-assess much more often and much more objectively. This resorted in a change of my views on many things, and I would say that these new views are better than the old ones.

19n9ak,53,c8r0k4y,c8qy89i,1.362608745E9,[deleted],,1,"To 1. There is no 'nature of religion itself'. Religions have been isolationist, and active and charitable and horrible. You must show that religious people in general commit more violence than atheists for your accusation to be true. [sauce](http://theotherjournal.com/2011/02/15/religion-and-its-discontents-a-review-of-the-myth-of-religious-violence/)

To 2. This is a popular sterotype, but there are many counter examples. Augustine, Peter Stove, Leah Libresco, Edward Feser, Gilbert Keith Chesterton, Dorothy Day are all converts to one pariticular form of religion (Catholicism) on intellectual reasons alone. Additionally, the study [What Americans Really Believe](http://www.amazon.com/Americans-Really-Believe-Rodney-Stark/dp/1602581789) does not bear this out in fact (credulity is hard to measure in the lab so surveys are important)

&gt;The Baylor Survey found that traditional Christian religion greatly decreases credulity, as measured by beliefs in such things as dreams, Bigfoot, UFOs, haunted houses, communicating with the dead and astrology (Ch. 15, <&quot;>Credulity: Who Believes in Bigfoot<&quot;>). Still, it remains widely believed that religious people are especially credulous, particularly those who identify themselves as Evangelicals, born again, Bible believers and fundamentalists.

To 3. Atheists use circular logic. You must demonstrate that religious people all things held equal will use circular logic more often. Note that a conversation with your low IQ uncle who is a fundementalist does not count due to confounding variables. A good test (if a small sample size) would be to compare people at your level with religious people at your level. 

To 4. Is a Religious person more likely to have negative feelings toward homosexuals? Yes. I will give you 4.

To 5. I disagree but this is a discussion that will spin out and take a large amount of time. Therefore I won't address it beyond saying that the ethical principles derivable from the Bible (often referred to as Classical Natural Law) do not allow Chattle Slavery or Rape. I would concede that people have used the Bible as a positive endorsement of these practices but of course I would. So unless you want to get into a long discussion of heumanutics (or the  study of reading texts) I suggest we table this for a later time.

To 6. This is a worthless statistic because it does not compare exploitation of children per member of a group. In a nation where all are atheists, only atheists would abuse children. In a ntion where all are muslims, only muslims would abuse children. Your task would be to establish with sociological data that religious people are more at risk than non religious people. 

To 7. This begs the question because what is taken to be a fairy tale is precisely at issue. Whether or not the beliefs of religious people are in fact fairy tales is what is to be proved and therefore you cannot assume it when evaluating religion. 
 
To 8. I already presented evidence that this is the case uses a peer reviewed study. 

What is in question is if Religious People are more Moral as traditionally measured (crime, charity, adultury, harder working and so on). I have provided 9 studies to this effect. Whether or not religious claims are true. It does seem to be the case. So your quote is the logical fallacy of non sequitur since nothing follows from the fact that religious people are wrong or atheists are smarter. To take a fictional example, House is smarter than all his peers. He is also nasty, lying, occasionally stealing, always manipulating. It takes a high IQ to work in Bear Sterns but I doubt you think that the people who work on Wall Street are more likely than others to be more moral. One can be right and immoral. Assertions 2, 3, 7 and 8 have nothing to do with that question. You quote has nothing to do with that question. If we take the quote to be a unique assertion then over half your comments are non sequitur. If the quote is not included then only half of your comments are non sequitur. 

I have given you rejoinder to every point you made. I have disputed 1-3, Given 4. Sketched briefly my objection to 5 but conceded that a true conversation would take a while. I have pointed out an inductive fallacy in 6 (sampling bias) and a logical fallacy in 7 (begging the question). I have already proven 8. Finally in light of your quote I tried to re-establish the question of the thread and have noted that you failed to address that question around half the time.",,null,null,,0.118,0.799,0.083,-0.987,16,4,13,56,123,71,48,184,186

How does it deprive schools of funding? Public schools are funded by the taxes collected from local, state, and federal governments. That's why they're called public schools, they're funded by the entire public.

&gt; School choice only benefits the privileged.

And so what? If public schools are not functioning choosing to use an alternative school won't hurt the public school's performance. Countries in Europe with amazing public school systems still have private schools that are basically prep for university life. 

Having people who are well off enough to use alternative schools doesn't affect the public school's ability to be a good system of education. Certain laws, guidelines, funding, and structures must be in place for a functioning education system.

&gt; Alternative school measures are less accountable.

I've never been in an alternative school system, but plenty of my friends have. Alternative schools have higher levels of education than almost any public school. A private school close to here is known for being very strict, difficult to get into, and they're categorized as a College Prep school.

Also, to home school you have to meet requirements set by the state. The state still gives standardized tests and assessments that the student must meet, so it's not like the parent/tutor can just slack off.

&gt; Alternative schools provide less choice to students.

[This is one of the best private schools in my state](http://www.battlegroundacademy.org/default.aspx). They clearly offer tons of variety. I know children who went to that school and they loved it. They offer athletics, arts, student organizations, community service opportunities, and a huge variety of classes. If you're talking about a more specialized school then that would be up to the individual student. We do have a more artistic, easy-going charter school that only takes Middle and High school students, but it focuses only on the Arts. 

Again, it's up to the individual student and depends really on what school you're talking about.

&gt; Alternative schooling is bad for educators.

What alternative school are you talking about? The private schools all over our state pay their educators *huge* salaries, because the school has more funding. Also, these private schools know that the people paying to go there are expecting an above average education and thus they only higher extremely qualified staff. I know a charter school around Nashville that almost only employed staff with a Doctorate, Master's Degree, or several small degrees. 

&gt; School choice allows parents to take their stake out of the game.

Not everyone who has a child in an alternate learning situation puts *all* their children in that same place. I know families who home schooled one child, and the rest of their children were in a public school. 

&gt; The fact is that we're educating a society, not just our own Johnny and Susie. Cheapening public education by siphoning off it's resources into hair-brained 'choice' schemes only weakens the whole system.

That isn't what changes an education system. If a community would elect leaders, politicians, and representatives that actually care about education then the system would change for the good. Again, Europe has a major focus on its own education system and they have a functioning system, but citizens are still free to choose what type of education to offer their children.

How many people are actually in a public school system has little to do with how well it works. Mostly it comes down to funding, having the correct people on the Board of Education, putting a major focus on school staff and educators, a cultural focus on the importance of school and education, a family history of educational success, and basically other common knowledge.",,null,null,,0.031,0.871,0.098,0.9923,9,9,8,12,111,112,29,103,124

School voucher systems, at least, tend to take the money that would have gone to a public school and use it to pay for the private school's tuition.

And (to get slightly off-topic) since the idea generally comes from the same general group of people who claim that government scholarships and loans inflate the cost of college and are therefore bad, I am led to wonder precisely what the point of such measures are, if not to funnel public funds to private institutions.",,null,null,,0.096,0.904,0.0,-0.7949,2,0,1,4,14,19,4,16,18

For a second here, let's forget the teachers, the schools, the parents. Let's focus on me‚Äîthe student. The students should be the the main focus; *we* are the ones who's futures depend on our education now. 

If you are curious as to how public school is going now-a-days, it's fucking not. Not in the two American states I've lived in, at least. I've had the most terrible teachers whom my principals would not or would not be able to fire (eg. didn't answer questions, lost kids' assignments, spent more time yelling at us than educating us, etc.) and I have only once had a teacher who was above average, who actually helped the students and seemed to care about us. Furthermore, the overcrowding in my high school is tremendous. In the hallways, it's like walking around in a walled-in, relatively narrow, busy China street full of annoying, slow, loud, inconsiderate teenagers. The overcrowding of adjectives in that last sentence somewhat describes the feel of the hallways. Added to, we only had 4 minutes to get to class, which was a serious challenge. This brings me to unfair and stupid rules. Not that we don't need rules, but many of them were just dumb, and most of the parents and teachers agreed.  No matter how many complaints the school board got about rules and other things, it didn't matter. It was simply ridiculous. They don't care about the kids at all, and if they did it sure wasn't showing. Another thing is that time is wasted severely in public schools. Think of all the time wasted in organizing things, telling kids to shut up, lecturing kids on anything but school, waiting in lines and so many other things. There is so much paperwork, as well. Both related to school and unrelated, the paperwork is over cumbersome and mostly unnecessary. Since *elementary school* I have had at least two hours of homework everyday and a project or a few almost every weekend. Trying to fit fun or any extra activities in literally caused me bad health and bad grades. There are just so many general things wrong with public school, especially now. From what many adults have told me, knowing their kids have to put up with in school, it has become very corrupt over the past years.

And now to the individual student. Public school sucks, but some people can do it. Some simply cannot. Some like me. I am a huge introvert in a very literal sense. Being around so many people all day exhausts me to no end. Also, I have a form of thyroiditis that, as I understand it, is incurable. This incurable disease I have causes fatigue. On top of those things, I'm anemic and have bad muscle spasms in my back. I come home everyday and sleep, get woken up for dinner, go back to sleep, wake up the next day and do it again. If I try to do homework after school I fuck it up because I'm too tired to hold a pencil steady or keep my eyelids open. Sometimes I'd try really hard to stay up and end up literally vomiting in my exhaustion. I also sleep pretty much all weekend because I have to take a muscle relaxer or else it hurts like shit in school, making it very hard to concentrate. Fucking horrendous. I don't feel sorry for myself and I know I'm not the only one and I know it could be worse; but public school simply is not an option for me unless I push myself to death or insanity, which I actually felt on the brink of at one point. 

Last year was when I drew the line. I had flunked algebra and only just passed my other classes because I was pretty good at tests. I was literally sick and tired of working so hard, having no friends and no free time, doing all I could for my health, and still failing. Just thinking about it almost brings me to tears. I wanted to get into a good college and I really thought I wouldn't get into any college or even pass high school at all at the rate I was going. It was the worst feeling because I couldn't help it. No matter how hard I worked, I ended up in shit. So I talked to my parents about home schooling, telling them that I truly thought I would have to drop school and try something else if I couldn't find another option‚Äîand that really is how I felt. My family and I knew we couldn't really afford it and my parents couldn't teach me. So I raised money all summer. Got a job (which was a huge challenge for a 15-year-old in a college town), sold many of my things, and did extra side jobs like babysitting and lawnmowing and whatnot. I worked my ass off all summer for online homeschool courses. 

How it was worth it. My god. My life in the past year has been amazing. I am making straight A's which is something I haven't done since kindergarten. I am taking the coolest classes that I would have never had the chance to take in public school, like anthropology and European medieval history and Greek mythology (things that will actually count towards my potential career, which I'd like to be something related to history). The classes themselves are extremely better in quality‚Äîgoing at my own pace and having better resources, I feel like I am actually learning rather than just taking meaningless words and regurgitating them onto paper. As someone who really has a thing for learning, I feel like I'm actually *going somewhere*. In public school, you just have to prove yourself, in which case faking it is an option. Lately, I'm thinking that faking it is the whole point of public school, which makes me very glad I've started home schooling. It's not just school that has improved for me either. Now that I have some time on my hands, I've started getting into things like archery and reading and writing. I've got a job that I can work at often, bringing in lots of money for someone of 16 years old. I've started working out which as been tremendously good for my health‚Äîmy blood levels are just right as of now except for, ya know, once a month. I've got more energy than ever. I have time and energy for friends. 

The quality of my life is so much better since I opted out of public school, and you know what? Fuck the school, fuck the teachers, I just don't care. They have done nothing for me, absolutely nothing. This is *my* education and *my* life, and I think I have the right to a good one if I'm willing to work for it. You just have to remember that school is‚Äîor should be‚Äîabout the kids, and they shouldn't be forced to stay in a such a bad position if their public school is failing them. There are kids who are irresponsible and don't care or just don't want a job that requires an education, but the options need to be out there for kids like me, too.

EDIT: apologies for bad wording and grammar and such, I'm young and ignorant.

EDIT2: Also, the home school option needs to be out there for children looking to go into or are in careers like acting or singing or sports, whatever. My little brother is young but is quite serious about wanting to move to LA to go into the film business.

Especially if we move to LA we will have to go back and forth between our homes. He needs to have his education for a backup if he doesn't become successful in film, which we all know is very likely.",,null,null,,0.141,0.747,0.113,-0.9946,12,18,34,53,146,92,114,266,318

&gt; Let's focus on me.

This may be the fundamentally most important point of my OP. *It. Is. Not. All. About. You*. Your experience with public education is not typical, but you've generalize to assume that, because the system failed you, the system is flawed. Between 94%-99% of Americans attended public schools, and society has not collapsed: what is being done is working for the vast majority of people. It's better to reach for the tiny minority that fall through the cracks than to tear down an entire system that is (only recently) failing the few.

&gt; the overcrowding in my high school is tremendous.

This wouldn't have anything to do with budget cuts, would it? I mean, it's not like they're packing you into classrooms forty-deep because they think it's *fun*... The whole tone of the preceding paragraph makes it sound like your school is full of sadists: ya know, excepting your classmates, who *are* sadists. Are your teachers distant and uncaring because they're a bunch of kid-hating curmudgeons who chose a radically wrong profession, or are they over-worked, under-paid, educated professionals frustrated by the constant decline in support and funding? 

&gt; I have had at least two hours of homework everyday and a project or a few almost every weekend...

Enjoy the working world. Pro-tip: those fun little devices that you use to play Angry Birds and sext each-other will eventually mean that *work never stops*. Just try to send someone to voicemail when it means you don't make your bonus for the month. You have it *sooo* good now, and you don't even know it.

&gt; I am a huge introvert in a very literal sense.

Yo! Me too! After a long day of meeting with clients, the thought of talking to *one more person* (aside from my wife) is physically exhausting. The thing about introversion is that it's: 

&gt;*the state of or tendency toward being wholly or predominantly concerned with and interested in one's own mental life ...people whose energy tends to expand through reflection and dwindle during interaction.*

See, introversion vs. extroversion isn't about how you function best, or what you need to be happy and successful: it's about *how you recharge*. We introverts decompress by being alone, free to contemplate and put our thoughts in order. Extroverts (like my wife) recharge by finding meaning and context through their interactions with others. Just like an extrovert would become depressed and overly introspective if left without people for too long, we get burned out if we can't get away and be by ourselves. Being an introvert doesn't give you licence to withdraw from society: it just means that you need to assert your need for 'alone time'. As a student, there's no reason why you shouldn't have ample time to turn off your phone, tell your folks you need some time alone, close the door, and introvert it up. Just like an extrovert would become manic and burn out with constant social interaction, we introverts need to see the world, interact with people, and make connections: else we go mad from loneliness. All things in balance.

&gt; I have a form of thyroiditis...

Sucks. It runs in my family (though I didn't develop it). Shouldn't that be addressed with your health care provider and not blamed on the school? There are effective mitigational measures for thyroid conditions, but I don't think your English teacher can provide them.

&gt; I had flunked algebra and only just passed my other classes because I was pretty good at tests.

Yo. Lit major.

&gt; Got a job (which was a huge challenge for a 15-year-old in a college town), sold many of my things, and did extra side jobs like babysitting and lawnmowing and whatnot. I worked my ass off all summer for online homeschool courses.

All of that with a thyroid condition? You'd think that, if you could mow lawns, care for children, and work a part-time job, you'd be able to stay awake in class. Amazing what you can accomplish when you're dedicated to success. 

&gt; In public school, you just have to prove yourself, in which case faking it is an option.

Faking is always an option (and often: the best option). Wait until you apply for that job you *really, really* want, but you're not *quite* qualified for. Sometimes, I think that the most important skill I learned in high school was the ability to prioritize the things that *needed* to be done over the things that I could half-ass or fake my way out of. In the digital economy, there will always be more work than you can accomplish, and knowing what what work and what to shirk may save your job some day.

&gt; I've started getting into things like archery and reading and writing...  I've got a job ... I've started working out.

So, PE, English, and work-study? The opportunities were there, dude. You just didn't take advantage of them.

&gt; Fuck the school, fuck the teachers, I just don't care.

God, I wish this had been the first sentence of your post. Would have saved me a lot of time. 

&gt; This is my education and my life... they [kids] shouldn't be forced to stay in a such a bad position if their public school is failing them.

*They* don't get to decide, because they are children, and they are biologically predisposed to making bad decisions. They don't get to decide when a school is 'failing' because they have no longitudinal context to make such assertions. You have, at absolute max, thirteen years of experience to draw from (and it's doubtful how much of that you can contextualize). We've been doing this schooling thing for 100+ years, and it almost universally works. As I said up top, just because the school failed *you* doesn't make it a failing school. 

&gt; EDIT2: Also, the home school option needs to be out there for children looking to go into or are in careers like acting or singing or sports, whatever.

I can speak to this as the husband of a professional actress (as in: she makes a comfortable independent living in the theater in both talent and administrative roles): aptitude and dedication will always win out. You make it in the industry by showing up, doing the hard and difficult shit, and becoming a presence. Flashes in the pan are just that: they burn bright for a second, but they're gone just as soon as they arrive. Wanna know the most important thing that education (high school and college) will teach you and demonstrate to you peers?

Commitment.

I'll say it again: commitment.

The ability to put up, push through adversity, and succeed despite unfavorable circumstances. That's how you win. You stacked the deck against yourself by blaming the system, falling back on your disabilities, and took the easy road. And, straight up, it might work out for you. But the moment you break through will be the moment you legitimately triumph over a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, and look back at everything before and think: 'I could have done so much more.' I'm not one of those 'bootstraps' assholes, but I do know the value of owning your successes and your failures.

I have gotten all of their opinions and most of them agree. The rate at which kids have gone into alternative options of schools has gone up dramatically lately - there is a reason for that. I don't think the public school system will ever fall. We, in our nation, realize how important it is to offer education to everyone, whether they can afford it or not. But if they get less funding, then maybe they will finally consider what they are doing wrong and try to fix it. We can't just let free education become a shithole system, and that is what it is beginning to come to. It isn't yet, but it's getting there. It's been getting worse and worse, so why would it be any different in the future unless we do something about it?

As I said before, the number of kids going to alternate schooling options has gone up dramatically in the past years, and there is a reason for it. I don't know what that reason(s) was for the numbers going up initially, but it wasn't funding at the time. Something else needs to be fixed and the people running the school systems need to realize it.

Didn't you read what I had said about sleeping all the time and having no friends? Who was I around to suck away my energy other than people at school? I am *not* blaming my thyroiditis on school. That makes no sense. I have most certainly gone to a doctor for it. I have [Hashimotos thyroiditis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashimoto's_thyroiditis) where, even if I get my thyroid levels at the right place, effects can still be there. There's nothing I can do about that. 

Actually, doing what I was doing during the summer wasn't nearly as draining as school was. I had time to myself, time to relax, but still was able to do things that were actually *productive*. That's one thing that I have against public school is that I felt I was doing nothing productive, which was very frustrating. In home school, I am productive and still getting a proper education. Magic. If public school were anything like home school, I would probably still be there.

Ya know? Maybe I don't want a job that includes <&quot;>faking it.<&quot;> Maybe I actually want to learn a thing or two, which public school has provided me very little of. I intend to hopefully have my own business where I don't have to fucking fake it for people and where most of what I do is productive and meaningful.

Look, PE was bullshit. English was bullshit. Work-study isn't available until senior year. PE was 20 minutes a day (because of all the time wasted) of running around, jumping rope, and being yelled at. Coaches don't give a shit unless you're in a school sport. Also, I was interested in strengthening some specific muscles because I've got hyper mobility in my joints, which they weren't gonna do in PE because I'm just one person - not blaming them, it's completely irrational to expect them to focus on one person, but I needed to do what I needed to do for me. English, as I said, was too busy trying to get me to fake it to actually teach me anything. I took nothing from English except for how *exactly* to write my name, date and teacher's name on the top of my paper.

Okay, it was obvious to me that public school just wasn't working for me. I was trying so hard and hardly getting along. If I'm so predisposed to making bad decisions, then why is home schooling doing so well for me? Why do I finally feel like I'm getting a proper education without any unnecessary bullshit? As ignorant as I am, I needed to try something else because I was really hoping that public school isn't all there was. It wasn't, and my life is wonderful. I have teachers who care (teachers with the same salary as public school teachers, mind you), I am being productive, I am confident now that my future will have a much better chance of being a bright one. There is *no reason* for me to put up with something that's not working for me if there is another way. 

I think I have given you the wrong impression of what my life is now. It is not the <&quot;>easy road<&quot;> at all. I'm still working hard, but for one, it's doable. Under my circumstances, it's never really easy, but it's doable. For another, it's productive. I'm working hard for *real things*, which is a much better motivation than *maybe* getting into an *okay* college. I'm working for real money, real health, real education, and real possibilities for my future. I never mind working hard when it actually goes to something positive. I have the ability and means and people willing to help, that give me options for my future that aren't as bullshitty as public school is. My life will turn out much better than it would have were I in public school now, I'm quite optimistic about that.

I said it once and I'll say it again. If I am willing to work to give myself a better life, I should have the means of doing so. I won't support a system that has given me nothing when that is its purpose; why should i? If I didn't have any other option, I would drop out anyway, so the school system wouldn't get my support either way and I would just have a bad future. 

Don't patronize me. I am perfectly aware of my ignorance in the world. However, I would be much more ignorant if I were still in public school, and I know that for a fact. I don't settle for ignorance if I can help it, and there is no reason that I should.",1,c8rtzyp,null,,0.105,0.784,0.111,0.8043,10,7,25,29,111,103,79,173,259

My state paid 75% of my tuition to take classes at the local community college, and gave me 2x high school credit for every class I took through the college. I graduated high school with 3/4 of an AA, and it set me up for a BA with no debt, taking classes I legitimately cared about and found interesting.

I just wish you would have had those opportunities *within* the system. I live in a fuckin' rich people town, so our public schools are *swank*, with lots of opportunities for specific intelligences and advanced classes. I think you and I have a lot in common: I was bored a hell in high school, until I took the opportunities to challenge myself. I feel bad that those opportunities were not allowed to you. 

But this speaks directly to my OP. If you could have everything you have now: self-directed activity, extra-curricular options, work study: would you have still bailed on schooling? I don't know where you live, or what kind of community you live in: but know that, in wealthier communities, kids have all the options you crave handed to them through public schooling. Since school funding is tied to property taxes, the richer your area is, the better your schools will be. My objection to 'school choice' is that it takes already limited resources and funnels them into communities that *already* have the means to provide better for their children.

My school district has two high schools. The one I attended was built in the 70s, had out-dated technology, larger class sizes, and lesser-paid teachers. The one my sister attended (because she was an athlete, and was grated a transfer), was built in the last decade, had modern tech, better teachers, and smaller classes. The fact that *choice* existed was what allowed one school to suffer while the other prospered. If funding was distributed equitably across the district (or, dare I to dream, the entire nation), I would be fine with parents or students choosing whatever educational opportunities they felt serves them best. But in the present system, when one moves, the money follows. 

The only way to correct this unbalance is to have one, centralized educational system that distributes all funding equally: across all students and all schools. No more rich kid schools with MacBooks for every student: no more poor schools for 40+ kids in each class. Every time we fragment the education system, with home-schooling, with charter schools, with vouchers, we're just admitting that it's too *hard* to provide each and every student with the resources they need. Somewhere out there, there was a school district with a RN who would have helped you with your thyroid condition, a counselor who would have helped you learn to mitigate your introversion, and teachers who had smaller class sizes and a living wage that would have had the time and resources to see to your specific needs. You think it's fair that kids in rich towns got what you so desperately needed? For you: I totally understand why you went elsewhere for your education. But it's not the fault of your school that they couldn't provide: every kid that signed up for charter school, that home-schooled, that went to private school, took money out of their pockets: money that could have could have helped you have a positive experience in high school. That decision was selfish, and (in my perfect world) they would never have had the ability to make it.

I oppose school choice because I want everyone to stay in the system, to make it better for *everyone*. I want everyone to have the same opportunities I had growing up in a wealthy community. I believe the resources are there, and are currently being allocated disproportionally to the children of the privileged. The system that you object to is a system in which those with the ability to choose alternative schooling pull their money, and those without that ability are forced to stay and deal with the consequences. If we gave every family a 'stake in the game': without the opportunity to drop out and seek education elsewhere, we would see the aggregate quality of public education increase across the spectrum.",,null,null,,0.058,0.8,0.142,0.9959,5,9,10,20,66,45,27,110,178

Furthermore, I believe that alternative schools have more opportunity to abdicate their social responsibility to their students.

To address you points:

&gt; Food choice only benefits the privileged ... Housing choice only benefits the privileged ... Car choice only benefits the privileged ...

Our country is constantly having a debate over the role of government in our lives. At present, the societal consensus is that the things you listed (housing, food, transportation) are not the government's responsibility to ensure. We have safety nets in place that make up the difference when citizens are unable to afford food and shelter (not sure about transportation), but ultimately we (as a society) have decided that the above are up to the individual. Education is not this way. Society has decided that the education of the children is a public good, and should be funded publicly. As above, I would support alternative schooling as long as families still contribute the same amount to public education, but the 'per head' funding system belies this. 

&gt; I dunno what private schools you have been to, but all the one's i have heard about pay their teachers extremely well.

I agree that private schools pay above average wages. I should have been more specific: the problem mostly lies in charter schools, who employ teachers with less education, retain those teachers for shorter periods, and pay below market wages. I maintain that (because of 'per head' funding, home-school tax credits, and vouchers) school districts will have less money to compensate teachers, which drives down the average teacher salary and makes it more difficult to attract qualified teachers. 

&gt; <&quot;>Less choice to students?<&quot;> Maybe the students and parents should decide whether the student needs to specialize, instead of relying on some <&quot;>feelings<&quot;> unbacked by any research.

I maintain that it is dangerous to funnel young people into specific fields of study or vocations at the pre-collegiate level. Even colleges require all students to take *some* amount of general education requirements to produce a well-rounded graduate: why should pre-collegiate education be any different? The tradition of liberal arts education goes back to the Greeks, and to ensure maximum success in life, I think we should create an environment in which students are exposed to a maximum amount of learning experiences. The best way to ensure this is to create an environment in which *all* options are available. I ended up majoring in literature, but I'm glad that I was forced, in high school and college, to take basic mathematics and sciences. All children need basic skills for life, and things like performing arts or STEM charter schools deprive kids of those opportunities.

&gt; Accountable?...

As I posted in a response above, my concern is for a basic measure of competency, but also for the general responsibility of the educational community to the welfare of the child. Like it or not, educators have become 'second parents': they see these children about as much as their parents do (8 hours in school, 8 hours at home, 8 hours of sleep). 
This is where I might take the most umbrage with private schooling. Private schools are ultimately most accountable to the parents: the people writing the tuition checks. In cases where there is a discrepancy between the well-being of the child and the satisfaction of the parents, it's only logical that the school would side with the parents. It is in the school's best interest to keep children enrolled: regardless of the well-being of the child. Private schools have a significant incentive to pass failing students, overlook behavioral issues, and ignore signs of a disruptive or dysfunctional household, if it means holding on to that tuition check for another year. A private school is a business, and there's really *no* incentive to issue corrections as long as the money keeps flowing. If you were a private school administrator, would you flunk the child of your foremost donor for any reason, if doing so would mean that you'd lose a majority of your funding? 

If I could half-‚àÜ, I would: simply for reminding me that the wealthy will always have the means to seek other options outside of the mass of society, and it's fruitless to imagine a world in which those with means and power won't deign to consort with the masses, and their progeny will benefit from their largess. My concern is for those left behind. I appreciate the fact that families who live in million+ homes contribute more in property taxes to their local schools: as it should be.

The rich will always have the means to have school choice. The poor are condemned to bad schools because their parents cannot move elsewhere. I think it's pretty callous to write these children off because you think it will make more parents run for the PTA on the off chance they may be able to improve the school system.

School vouchers enable poor and working class a privilege which has been reserved for the wealthy. Why should these children be forced into terrible, dangerous schools? These bad schools are *horribly failing them* now.

&gt;School choice allows parents to abandon their neighbors and peers and simply opt out of the system.

It allows everyone to send their children to schools which will actually educate them in a safe atmosphere... the choice which the rich currently have and privileged already practice by moving to nicer neighborhoods. Interestingly, parents already abandon their neighbors by moving to nicer neighborhoods. The people stuck in these dangerous, violent, failures are the poor.

&gt;accountability

School choice pressures school administrators (both public and private) to improve the education they are offering. It does so in an immediate and individualized fashion. Instead of maybe listening to parent complaints or some poor, working parent spending his time trying to run for the PTA or schoolboard, they are threatened with losing their jobs because the money to pay them is going to a school which the parent thinks does a much better job. The difference in the effort for each parent to hold public school officials accountable versus school administrators in a voucher system is enormous. When you factor the likelihood of a poor, working class parent being elected to a schoolboard against a privileged, sitting member and actually changing it for the better, I think school choice should win out.

Why is competition good in other areas of life (food, pizza delivery places, cars, appliances, consumer goods, package delivery, **colleges**), but not in education? All of your <&quot;>criticisms<&quot;> could be applied to pretty much any of these things. Do you find them convincing in those areas? If not, why not?

Our college system (which acts like a school choice system with federal loan grants) is a marvel of the world. People from all over come to the U.S. to be educated. Why is our k-12 system failing so horribly?

&gt;Alternative schools pay lower wages, are less likely to retain teachers, are less likely to employ certified educators

So what? Education shouldn't be a jobs program for teachers, it should be an education system for children.

&gt;Alternative school measures are less accountable.

Why not let parents decide if the education being offered is better or worse? Standardized tests are notorious for being terrible at accurately gauging teacher or student performance.

Education should not be one-size-fits-all, it should be individualized and school choice is how we can reasonably get there. Forcing both educators and children into the same mold leads to failing results... and unfortunately, <&quot;>public<&quot;> anything without competition means <&quot;>one-size-fits-all.<&quot;> Maybe in theory that isn't true, but in the real world it is.",,null,null,,0.143,0.759,0.098,-0.9778,10,1,20,22,174,153,39,117,142

Government schools are dangerous in many ways to a free people.  A government is only an organization that has a monopoly on violence and force in given area.  Why should such an organization educate my kids?  Why should money be stolen from your grandmother to pay for my education?

Here's how it works:  

Let's make me leader of the state where our kids will live.  I've heard the voters, and they want good schools for their kids.  I'm a gracious and opportunistic politician, so I announce <&quot;>FREE<&quot;> education for our kids!

1.  First we to pass laws requiring all kids of a certain age go to our governmental schools.  This FREE school stuff is so good it's mandatory.

2.  Now we pass laws to tax everyone's real estate in this new school district.  (Let's go with high taxes to keep poor people out of the area.)

2A.  Gonna need some police here to make sure we get those tax funds and to throw people out of their homes if they don't pay.  (It's for the best you know.)

3.  Now let's hire the best contractor to build the school and put that new pool in my backyard.  Tickets to the NFL game would be nice too.

3a.  Might need to build a jail and new police department too if too many people decide to not pay those taxes for the common good of the children.  Because all this FREE government schooling is for the children. Better increase those taxes.

4.  After the golden shovel ground breaking of this new school, I'll head over to this certain group's head-quarter's called the government worker's union hall.  They were quite instrumental in my election and I like the union boss as he was also helpful with that time-share in Miami.

5.  At the union hall, I work out a contract with the boss to hire the best teachers for our children.  The cost of labor isn't important to me.  First, I really don't care if the labor costs are too high as it's not my money and second, my kids won't go to the school.  All I know is these serfs I rob want schools, and I want votes, and the serf's vote for me and the union pays for my election.  So as long as these union guys don't strike and the serfs vote, I don't care what it costs or how effective this school is.

6.  Then I'll determine what these serf kids will learn in this new citadel of governmental indoctrination.  This I somewhat care about.  Not for the next election, but for my cronies.  I'd like for the kiddies to pledge their allegiance to the state everyday.  I want them to learn what the state wants them to learn, and how the state expects them to behave.  My concern is not that they become free thinking extraordinary people, but that these kids become good servants to the state and all its agencies.  I'll even bring in the police to the schools to get them used to the police and maybe even teach the kids to snitch on their mommies for smoking pot.  I need to keep the jails full as I've privatized the jails and I've got buddies to keep employed on the taxes.

7.  Once the government schools open, I'll make it as similar to prison as possible.  Even the same menus for the food.  Only let them move when my union friends want them too.  Sit down, shut up, and pray for the bell to sound.

8.  Now I'll set up all kinds of governmental agencies to <&quot;>assist<&quot;> and <&quot;>guide<&quot;> and <&quot;>test<&quot;> these schools.  This takes more money.  Doesn't educate anyone, but it does employ my friends and makes them other people's money.  Free education is best for the poor.  Don't these serfs care about the poor!?

9.  Now that I've distorted the market place in education by offering services that non-government schools can' match as my price beats everyone else's price, I'll quickly become the monopoly power.

10.  Rich people never sent their kids to this FREE governmental complex, but soon, middle class people are making sacrifices and sending their kids to tuition based schools.  So using my power as state I will harass these tuition schools and demonize the parents and kids.  Especially the home schoolers.  They're easy.  They have no organized voice.  

11.  Finally as my monopoly becomes even more corrupt, I'll blame my political opponent for the mess.  He/She want's to take money from <&quot;>public<&quot;> phones, no, I mean public housing, no, I mean public transportation, no, I mean public toilets, no, no, no, I mean public education!  It's FREE and has made the state great!  It's for the children! 

11.  Then I'll go after anyone who wants to break up this monopoly and resist any reduction to the flow of money to my campaign coffers/government school. 

I think that sums it up.

I've found that school choice is the tide which raises all boats. Students who enroll in choice schools are happier and achieve more. Their parents are more likely to cooperate with the school.

As a case in point, my child will be returning to public school next year because the local high school will allow her to enroll in calculus, literature and creative writing as a freshman. They won her back. She had transferred a charter in late grade school because they allowed her to enroll in classes at various grade levels and allowed her to learn quickly at her fast moving pace. The flexibility of the local school is earth shaking and reflects a totally new attitude. This is the same system that has never offered flexibility to any student in the past.

When parents choose alternative schooling, they pull money from the public schools, and use that money (in conjunction with their own) to educate their child. Many families don't have that option. All the additional costs I listed in the preceding paragraph may be totally out of reach for families at the bottom of the economic spectrum, and therefore alternative schooling will be totally inaccessible.

We live in a state that requires the family to pick up the cost for textbooks, but in the charter this was free. The charter also loaned each family a computer and would reimburse internet expenses for families if this was needed. Technology use is big because most classes involve a lot of teleconferencing. 

No uniforms and no transportation issues as we live far from any city and this was a virtual charter. On the down side, the many, many optional field trips were usually a couple hours away. Obviously no lunch issues. The cost a lot less than school lunches and were a lot healthier.  Extra-curricular activities were things we did on our own (city swim team, weekly book club), just as we had when enrolled at the public school with sucky, far-away, and infrequent activities. Art and music are optional. My kids did Latin and Spanish instead. We are talking grade school here, not high-school with all the clubs and after school events that come with high school. The extras are a good reason to go back when entering high school. 

Public school is not cheap where I live. Text books are several hundred a year (but free to those who qualify). Teachers ask you to bring another hundred or so each year in supplies. Field trips, sports and lunch money fees add up. Charters that pick up all the expenses are a better deal for many families. Given that public schools get about $8000 a year a kid, plus a truckload of extra money and charters get $4.800 to $6060 per kid, per year, you have to eventually wonder where the money is really going.

I should mention that the charter has some teams, plays, movie nights, clubs and dances, as well as a bunch of parents stuff (craft night, book club) but we didn't participate in any of that as we are a couple hours from the school.

While I agree with this statement, I disagree it's a conspiracy theory. Long story short, Bush's government (or rather, his advisers) decided to to invade Afghanistan to hunt down the man responsible. After some time of searching for him to no avail, Bush was starting to be though of as some weakling who can't even catch a <&quot;>caveman<&quot;>. He and his advisers knew that he needs to somehow improve his image, so that he could get reelected, so their best idea was, <&quot;>the neighbors have some dictator guy, we can overthrow him and be perceived as both good AND strong<&quot;>. Remember the good old <&quot;>Mission Accomplished<&quot;> picture? The whole Iraqi war was supposed to be a quick PR stunt to improve Bush's image, it eventually backfired.

&gt;I suggest there are groups out there who work together to keep systems in place for good or evil.

That's what I was saying in my original post, it's easier for you to think that than to accept there is nobody who keeps anything in place, there is no good and no evil, just people looking out for themselves, and maybe from time to time for someone else. Nobody is watching over this mess, nobody is in control.

&gt;<&quot;>why am I doing this<&quot;> and the answer is <&quot;>...<&quot;>

Actually there is an actual, simple, answer to that. It's survival, having a 9-5 job is the easiest and <&quot;>safest<&quot;> way to survive (via money, of course). If you have a <&quot;>better<&quot;> idea of survival, by all means go ahead and do it, just know that it won't be as safe as a 9-5.

When I'm saying safe, by the way, is that if you try making money (or live on land, or anything else) in any other way, you are risking something, it's either money (investing in something, or buying the land to live on) trouble with the law (getting money illegally, or living on land your don't own) or nature (living on some land that nobody owns, for example Antarctica).",,null,null,,0.101,0.794,0.104,0.1324,14,3,9,25,225,214,34,61,123

If the former, I'd say: no problem! I really don't care for my wife's friends, and it doesn't impact our relationship. She's an actress, and if you've spent any time around theater people, you know that many (most?) of them are vapid, irresponsible, drink way too much, and are generally failing at life. When she goes to theater parties, I opt to stay home: I don't know anyone, and I don't want her to have to babysit me all night because I have nothing in common with her friends.

If it's the latter, things might be a bit more tricky. If your SO's friends are heavy drug users, for instance, and it's rubbing off on her, you're right: your relationship might be doomed. But if they're just general scumbags and you don't want to be around them: there's no reason why two reasonable people can't agree to keep parts of their social lives separate. 

A relationship is always a choice: would I be better off with this person or without them? Not to be too cheese-ball, but I do believe that 'love conquers all'. People love people with severe disabilities, they love people on different continents, they love people they can never be with. If you love this person enough, there's no reason that you can't be the bigger person and learn to live with her friends.

Another is that an SO could become privy to the secrets shared in confidence by the friend.

I started buying it because it was available in pints (my example above was inspired my my own small shared freezer) and because I really liked eating the strawberry and vanilla together.

You love tinkering with the system. Getting at the nuts and bolts. If tinkering in userland with your own workflows is your think, you'd do better to get a Mac.

What's more, I couldn't just run all the scripts I'd written for Linux, but I could integrate them much more tightly with the system thanks to software like Automator and the awful but wonderfully ubiquitous AppleScript. Any power-user app has an AS scripting dictionary, so it's fairly simple to add new functionality. And Services allow you to easily implement system-wide features.

Add a few third-party apps like Hazel, Alfred and KeyboardMaestro, and OS X is a powerhouse platform. From a user's point of view, it has all the power of Linux with none of the rough edges.

Sure, if you're a serious gamer, you'd be mental to buy a Mac. Also if you absolutely must have a specific app or device that only supports Windows. Note: for most mainstream tasks, there'll be a different Mac app that does much the same thing, but you won't be using one to write Windows software or program industrial controls.

OS X has many very powerful features that Windows doesn't that make power users like me (and I'm no fan of the actual hardware configurations Apple offers) shudder at the thought of having to switch. Built-in full-text indexing across the system with Spotlight (and tagging is trivially added) with Smart Folders means I can tag any file with TODO and have it show up in my TODO folder. Hazel tags any newly-downloaded video file as unmatched, and that shows up in a different folder.

Meanwhile, thanks to Services, I've added new system-wide functions that are a right-click away in *any* app (the advantage of the Cocoa monoculture). And these things are trivially easy to do; no black magic or hackery involved.

How would you do that on Windows?

If the GUI tools aren't enough, you can just pop open a terminal and do it the old *nix way.

Now, as I said above, I'm not a fan of Apple's hardware configurations (the Mac Mini is underpowered, the Mac Pro is way too expensive‚Äîand dead‚Äîand I sure as shit don't want to buy a computer with a built-in screen), but if they are your thing, you'll notice that comparable hardware from other vendors isn't always that much cheaper (for the same quality). If you want anything of comparable size and performance to a MacBook Air, you will pay just as much and your computer won't be as good (shitty trackpads, usually).

Sure, you can get a PC with the same processor and RAM for far less money. Just as you can get a Ford with the same horsepower and torque as a BMW for far less money. It's a question, then, of whether you appreciate the other things that BMW/Apple bring to the party. If not, Macs are silly and overpriced.

That is false. First, there are plenty of reasons not to want to use OSX (e.g. if you are a gamer or you like the wealth of software available to Windows users, you like the tinkering ability that comes with Linux, etc). 

And yes, a Mac can run non-OSX operating systems, but I'd say that they're not always or even usually the best computers for doing so. Outside of OSX battery life tends to be pretty poor (I believe because switchable graphics works only in OSX). The hardware is hard to access when it isn't locked down entirely. The screens, while fairly good, are generally outstripped by those of a large number of laptops (VAIO Z, for instance).

I also bought a VW GTI instead of a Subaru WRX or Mazdaspeed 3. Both those alternatives are faster on the track. One may even be cheaper. But when I sit behind the wheel of my GTI its refinements make me happy in subtle ways. I think the same is true of our electronics.

19sqh6,37,c8r3t3h,19sqh6,1.362618699E9,cp5184,4,6,"For one, the cost argument is often misunderstood or misrepresented.  For instance people will trot out a mac pro with all the bells and whistles, and compare it to the used compaq pentium 4 from 2001 being sold at their local electronics store for $79, and say <&quot;>why spend $20,000 when you can buy this computer for $79<&quot;>.  But when you price a dell to the same specs as the mac pro it costs $20,000.  It's the same with their laptops.

Now is that to say that that you can't buy a new, powerful desktop for less than $20,000?  Of course not.  But it's just as wrong to argue that dell and apple don't have the same markup on a $27 dollar 4GB stick of ram.

Then it comes down to choices.  Apple doesn't offer as many choices as ALL pc makers, or even a single one, like dell, or HP.  Dell and HP are fighting for the low margin shoppers.  Apple isn't.  If you're looking for a low margin desktop, don't buy apple.  They don't offer anything in the segment you're looking at.

With laptops things become a little trickier.  Laptop prices have come down a lot, and that's great.  And the above point still holds.  If you're looking for a low margin laptop, apple's probably doesn't have anything in that segment.  Yelling at them because you're comparing a 10<&quot;> dell laptop with a $20 intel atom processor, 2GB of ram, and a 16GB ssd with an apple laptop doesn't make any sense because that's not a segment apple caters to.  You might as well yell at marvel comics because the latest issue of batman isn't a laptop.

But every time I try to price out a similar dell laptop compared to an apple laptop, there's rarely much of a price difference.  And they usually gouge about the same on upgrades, like ram and hdd.

Now OS X.  Some people like it, some people don't.  If you've given it an honest chance and you don't like it there's not much I can say.

I will say a lot of the problems people have with apple software, and OS X I have with windows.  OS X assumes you want to install some new apple software when you check for updates?  So does Microsoft.  I've got plenty of complaints with Windows 7.  For instance why did they remove the <&quot;>are you sure<&quot;> dialog when you hit shut down in the start menu, particularly when they made the arrow that opens the dropdown for sleep so small.  Any child can see that's a disaster waiting to happen.

And people arguing Microsoft gives the user more control?  The trend with microsoft is taking away more and more control.

And people complaining about apple itunes locking people into the apple platform?  Guess what Microsoft's great new idea for windows 8 is?  Locking you into microsoft's platform.

A lot of people will tell you about how annoying apple zealots are...  I suppose there are a few die hard apple fans, just as there are die hard microsoft fans, people who will tell you that internet explorer 4 was such an amazing web browser that the public adopted it on their own over netscape, letting ie4 take over over 90% of the market...  But they ignore that the IT press at the time basically said that IE4 and netscape were equal, and they like to gloss over microsoft pushing ie4 as an update, pushing it with new windows installs, and paying millions to force people into agreements to not offer netscape in hard copy, back when hard copy is how most people got their browser, at a time when you couldn't just plug your computer into a router and be connected, a time when you needed specialized software from your isp to connect to dialup.

I've never been bothered much by either microsoft or apple zealots.  The people I can't stop running into are the loudmouth zealots who talk about how apple makes shit, how apple fans are idiots, how apple stuff is overpriced, how the iphone is shit, and how microsoft, and samsung are somehow the second coming of christ or something.  How they sell things for cost, or below cost.

People ragging on Apple for making their iphones in china as if apple is the only company to make stuff in china.  As if the people ragging on apple for making their expensive phones in china didn't get their xbox360 from the same foxconn chinese suicide factories.  And as if samsung doesn't make a profit on the galaxy s3.

On top of that, apple's actually basically the only company bringing manufacturing BACK to the US.  Every apple aluminium laptop case is made in the US.

And there's nothing you can do about those shitfaced suicide slave labor xbox360 owner loudmouths yelling about how apple is the antichrist.

You explain those guys to me please.

And I'm not an apple fan.  I don't use OS X.  I don't have an iphone.

Agree.

What constitutes cheating varies from couple to couple because boundaries vary from couple to couple. Cheating, in my mind, is anything that breaks those boundaries. I don't necessarily think that any particular act can be considered inherently cheating, but there are definitely more common boundaries out there, including physical relations. 

The reason it is important to understand this is there are definitely people and communities out there who suport the same way of looking at physical relations as you do. You shouldn't have to change the way you think (in my opinion, as I don't necessarily disagree with you) but it is ESSENTIAL to either accept it and seek partners who feel the same way or completely disregard your way of thinking if you find a partner who holds more conventional views.

They probably told that story around campfires, and the politicians quoted it in their speeches. We're no different.

I would agree with bantha and observe that almost all nations like to have a 'myth' of their national identity, based on common religion,race,beliefs,culture,history,language and/or traditions. It is like being in a big family with a family tree and family traditions. 


In some countries, there is a strong national identity based on religion, race and history, like Japan. The majority of Japanese citizens share a common culture, language, race and have a 'shared' history dating back thousands of years. Also, most people living in Japan are ethnically Japanese.


In Greece, Italy, China etc there is a long recorded history with heroes, battles, and the countries have their own race and language, to some extent.


America does not have such a long (recorded) history if we ignore (as most Americans do) Native American history. The US is also not racially homogeneous, there being European-Americans (whites) African-American, Native Americans and Hispanics. So how can the US find a sense of national identity? Partly (in my opinion) through support/deification of their 'founders' like Thomas Jefferson etc and their two infamous works: the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution. 


Though Americans are a diverse people, they can have a sense of national 'community' through celebrating shared beliefs: in free market capitalism, freedom of the individual, limited government, gun ownership etc. which are set out in the constitution. And of course, with this goes the 'deification' of the founders like Jefferson and Washington.


Because people have such support for the 'founding fathers' and the constitution they are frequently mentioned by politicians and philosophers. And in many cases, the founding father's beliefs are still relevant eg. in Freedom of religion or the separation of church and state or the belief in limited government. Or at least, we can guess what they would have thought. This rather conservative notion of thinking 'what would our forefathers have voted for?' has been termed 'Democracy of the Dead'.
However, when it comes to: Climate Change, Abortion, Stem cell research, NASA etc. it becomes impossible in my opinion at least. You might as well 'ask' George Washington how he likes his Ipod.


TLDR: Americans are a mixed bunch and have a relatively short history, so they celebrate shared beliefs and the men who first codified their belief system.",,null,null,,0.028,0.838,0.134,0.9914,5,2,14,10,55,24,44,75,102

I also don't think that Canadians are as noisily patriotic as Americans, though this is debatable.

However, I understand that many people in Quebec are very protective of their language, and believe that it is an extremely important part of their identity. The language is even protected/promoted by a public organisation:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise

So perhaps some (French) Canadians aspire to a 'myth' of national identity in their own way, through a unique language. 

I would guess that there are other ways in which Canadians celebrate their national identity. Presumably there are Canadian folk heroes similar to Robin Hood (UK), Sir Francis Drake (UK) and Ned Kelly (Australia). Or food/drink etc. Maybe an expert on Canadian culture/politics could give a better answer.

The celebration of a national 'myth'/heritage is often more popular in more nationalistic/patriotic countries, so this may partly explain it.

Fascist regimes for example often are very focused on racial identity and historic achievements eg. Hitler's master race / 3rd Reich (empire), and Mussolini's idea of another 'Roman Empire'. (Note that I am not suggesting that support for the founding fathers is fascist, simply that fascist regimes often have zealous support for racial hegemony, national heroes/ leaders and a concrete national identity.)

The reverence of the founders exists because reverence of the document was necessary. The whole point of a written constitution that required significant concerted effort to alter (at least initially) was to provide a firm and sturdy foundation on which to build an enduring nation. I wrote extensively in another thread recently about the cycles of government discussed by many of the political philosophers by whom the founders were influenced so I won't do it again here. 

Basically the idea is that a strong state is ordered by one (or few) men  and then the reigns are handed over to MANY as the many are more likel to conflict which slows the pace of change. Frivilous change leads to degeneration hastening the society's eventual transformation/fall. 

So to discourage change, and encourage the kind of civic virtue that I believe Lincoln spoke about in... The Lyceaum Address I think... lionaztion of the founders and the founding document are necessary. 

Now things get complicated after that because those who study these things will sometimes argue that the U.S. has had anywhere from 1-3 re-foundngs if memory serves. It may have even been four, counting the rise of Progressiveism (Which at least in its original form was anti-thetical to the idea of a written Constitution) and from there we get the idea of a living constitution though thats arguably only a continuation of the first arguable refounding (judicial review). 

In short we treat the Constitution as a near holy document (ever notice how priest-like the Supreme Court is in treatment and presentation most o the time?) and so the Founders must be diefied alon with it. Its for the sake of stability.

First, enacting an unconstitutional law will likely embroil the state/local government in litigation resulting in striking down the law. Even if I agree with the law, I might see this as a waste of resources that will fail to result in the benefit sought.

You appear to be trying to escape this result by saying your proposal should then be interpreted as an argument for a constitutional amendment. However, it is incredibly difficult to get an amendment to the constitution ratified. If a person supports passage of a law, it does not necessarily follow that a person supports passage of a constitutional amendment to the same effect. For people interested in practical results, it may make no sense to support a constitutional amendment that is doomed to failure if resources could be better spent on other related battles that would not require constitutional changes.

Finally, constitutions often enshrine abstract principles that people may theoretically agree with but fail to apply to specific situations. Sometimes pointing out that a policy likely violates a constitutional principle will get someone to view the policy from a different angle and change their views. For a personal example of this, I was once ambivalent with respect to drug testing of welfare recipients. I was not convinced that it made economic sense, but I was not particularly concerned with the idea in general, if it could be made to make economic sense.

I agree. I wasn't really talking about whether a state should attempt to pass a law that's likely to be deemed unconstitutional or not. In terms of efficacy, it seems inadvisable. I was, rather, referring to those that might hold the stance that a view's being inconsistent with the current constitution is an argument against the view in and of itself, not an argument against whether the view should be legislated or not.

&gt; If a person supports passage of a law, it does not necessarily follow that a person supports passage of a constitutional amendment to the same effect.

I agree with that, especially if there's a better avenue to pursue that aligns with the constitution but effects the same changes, as you mentioned.

&gt; For people interested in practical results, it may make no sense to support a constitutional amendment that is doomed to failure if resources could be better spent on other related battles that would not require constitutional changes.

This is a good point and probably one that makes me best modify my view on this. Together with an argument against the original position in and of itself, noting that the position is unconstitutional bolsters the idea that a particular change should not be pursued, since the effort-to-benefit ratio is increased, somewhat.

As for your last paragraph, it's a bit of an eye-opener. I hadn't thought of the unconstitutionality of something as stimulating critical thinking about *why* the particular position might contravene the constitution and the full ramifications of holding the view.

<&quot;>The Founding Fathers<&quot;> *aren't even a single group*.

At the very, very least, they were two radically different camps: The Federalists (headed by Madison), and their opponents (headed by Jefferson). The states often also didn't get along so that further fractured them.

The federalists wanted a strong central government, and in fact might even have been okay with a president-for-life (especially if the first one was George Washington, who both camps unanimously agreed was a good guy). The anti-federalists wanted the States to be a loose confederacy with a weak central government.

And when the country was founded, the anti-federalists won and drafted a constitution that created an incredibly weak central government.

That's not the constitution we use now, obviously; the central government was in fact so weak it could not collect taxes (it was to be funded *by donations from the states*) to pay our revolutionary war debts and so declared bankruptcy in a decade.

After that, the Federalists had enough political inertia to assert themselves as a faction the antifederalists had to deal with, meaning both camps had to compromise on everything.

And they didn't agree on anything, and the government was literally going to collapse if they didn't compromise - so they had to.

The Constitution is like the old-timey version of the Sequester. Nobody liked it. It's vaguely worded specifically so that both camps could, simultaneously, try to get what they wanted out of it with clever interpretations.

That's probably responsible for at least some of that worship; they wrote something as vague as any holy text. Two people with radically different beliefs about government can both find the government they want in the US Constitution, because two camps with radically different beliefs about government wrote their respective versions using identical wording.",,null,null,,0.07,0.829,0.101,0.8435,8,0,5,16,84,51,18,75,89

But because of the way birth control and child support work, I would argue that the metaphor should be *reversed*.

Think about it. A man has sex with a woman. The only form of birth control available to him, short of surgery, is condoms. They are not foolproof. Meanwhile, the woman can choose from a variety of pills and implants, and even if all those fail, it is her sole decision whether or not to get an abortion. If she chooses not to, the man must pay child support, even if he would not have kept the child.

Now you have a situation where rather than the man having the option of putting zero resources into the child, it is the woman who has that choice. She can either not have a child altogether, and benefit from the sex by getting pleasure with no consequences, or she can ensure the man shares the consequences.

A good key can open many locks *only if* those locks were designed to be opened by that key as well as a specific key. If a lock can only be opened by one key, in most scenarios it's a shitty lock. In, say, a hotel, a good lock can be designed to be opened by easily four or more keys (room key, housekeeping master key, maintenance master key, hotel master key). And this is without even going into the multiple copies of the same key thing.

That aside...

This is the 21st century. We don't live in caves, we don't eat our meat raw, and we don't die of old age at thirty. Why should we still bow to caveman gender stereotypes? Should we use the same logic to shame women for having a career instead of children?

Look at bonobo monkeys. They're our closest living relatives, and they are *constantly fucking*. You can't tell me it's in the nature of women to be monogamous and fuck-free when all of our primate relatives are constantly getting it on. Social standings? Morals? They change. Constantly. Look at parts of the middle east, where it's shameful for women to show their face in public. Look at history, at the polyandry in Tibet and Nepal and in pre-Christian Celtic cultures. Look long enough and you'll see a trend of Abrahamic religions bulldozing polygamy everywhere they encounter it and later claiming it's 'unnatural' because nobody does it any more.

Every argument that says it's shameful for women to fuck a lot of guys is either cultural or the direct result of cultural pollution in our perception of nature.

You specify that you are not talking about the metaphor itself, but the thought behind it. Fine. The metaphor is extremely biased. It is from a male only perspective (if it can be applied at all to the case you mention) and deliberately undermines the female perspective. In this way it is typically the kind of expression you would ABSOLUTELY not use if you were in female company in a casual non-hunting environment, like coworkers or something. This is in fact a metaphor that clearly defends the male <&quot;>right<&quot;> to open many locks,  and condemns the females right to do the same. it is an expression that can only be used to comfort or support the sad one-sided male line whereby they feel rejected or some such emotional problem.  
In practice, it is so one-sided that, as stated, you would avoid presenting it to the opposite sex, because you would show yourelf as being antagonistic towards them, which is a guaranteed no-result posture, if ever there was one.  
It's a comforting expression amongst males in a losing environment. It is designed to leave the <&quot;>lock<&quot;> no option, and control everything from the <&quot;>key<&quot;> perspective.  
To come back gently to your standpoint, ie the second paragraph, men and women are affected by their percieved role in society, and one could say there are prejudiced expectations involved, but they are ONLY DEFINED by the person in the other camp, specifically a male would say that, about( but not to) a female. You mention that a male or female could be defined as <&quot;>a stud or a slut<&quot;>. You know there are a million ways of defining an individual, and if a 3rd person were described to you as a normal thing, you would not be able to split them into one of 2 groups: <&quot;>slut<&quot;> or <&quot;> stud<&quot;>. These 2 words are 2 extremes, but from the one same perspective. If you are in an environment where this concept is mentioned, make sure to notice if somone is being comforted. They are. It is used only to reassure somebody is <&quot;>not wrong<&quot;>. I would say they ARE wrong. The comforting is only a momentary thing, and is specifically the way some males have of NOT talking about a subject.  
  If you are saying it's ok for males to screw as many individuals as possible, but not for a female to, then you are only qualifying yourself. You are saying you feel insecure about females who get more ass than you, and let's face it, they mostly all do on average. So this expression is a guy way of saying it's ok for you to feel insecure. If in any way you apply such a rule to an actual interaction (conversation) with a female, you will get rejected. You know that. And you know why? Because it's bollocks.  

Let me give you a sort of example. consider the sentence:  
<&quot;>there is nothing worse than a woman who can't tell one man from another<&quot;>  
This is a good answer to the female comment <&quot;>men are all the same<&quot;>.  
Now let's invert it: <&quot;>There is nothing worse than a man who can't tell one woman from another.<&quot;>  
This is also a good sentence. What you are proposing with your pitch, is that all women who <&quot;>put out<&quot;> are wrong. This is clearly a WILD underestimation of the types of women there are. This is a basic error. the reason it is wrong is that it was never meant for analysis. It is just one guy comforting another, or themself. And they are doing it by saying <&quot;>yes, you are right, don't feel bad<&quot;> when frankly you are stating bigotted agressive nonsensical bollocks about a person you obviously do not empathize with ( or understand).   
TL;DR - it is a phrase meant to comfort people when the opposite sex are not listening. It is an innate lie.

The only trans* person (a female-to-male [transman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_man)) whose story I know in any sort of detail had a growth hormone deficiency that his family didn't really notice until middle school, when it became obvious that he was growing at a much slower rate than all the other (female) children. He describes what happened soon after this discovery in an essay he wrote:

&gt;In order to aid my body I began taking growth hormone shots six days a week, pushing my body to catch up with my age; something I was not ready for on any level.  I instantly started experiencing changes that I couldn‚Äôt explain, changes I did not want. I started growing taller, but I also started growing breasts and having feelings that scared me. I hated that I was losing my flat chest; I tried denying it and refused to wear a bra as long as possible. These physical changes caused me to hide my body under layers of clothing. Nothing I tried was completely effective; the rate that my body was growing made it physically painful and more difficult to hide. I was successful for the most part in hiding the true size of my chest until it came to formal events where exposure was nearly unpreventable. This feeling of shame was something that was incredibly difficult for me to understand. I was a female. I should be excited to be drawing attention, right? I continued to struggle with this in silence, as I had no basic understanding behind why this was happening. This struggle became intertwined with my journey to understand my sexuality. 

Later in the essay, he describes how he started <&quot;>binding<&quot;> after he accepted his genderqueer identity, essentially wrapping tight fabric around his breasts to make his chest appear flatter and more masculine. Honestly, this image of tightly binding your breasts because you wish they weren't there makes me feel uncomfortable and when I first read the essay, I was thinking, <&quot;>Something is not right in his head. Something is 'unnatural.'<&quot;> But when I read it a second time, I thought, <&quot;>What those doctor's did--forcing him to rapidly undergo a process of puberty that is supposed to take several years--was unnatural and messed up.<&quot;> Both the doctors and my friend were put in a tough situation and did what they thought was best.

As briarme implied, there seems to be a distinction between people with gender dysphoria and those who consider themselves trans and don't have gender dysphoria.

19ztx1,0,c8ssrge,19ztx1,1.362873342E9,[deleted],,13,"Being shy does not necessarily make someone less likely to cheat. I think that cheating has a lot more to do with personal values about relationships. Of course, a lot of cheating is also completely circumstantial. It usually is due to a lack of something in the relationship, regardless of personality type. A lack of attention, or 'needs' being met, or whatever. Sometimes it's simply that one or both people in the relationship are done with the relationship, and act on that before it is finalized, perhaps to force the issue. That's not to excuse the behavior, rather to understand the motives.

I have had many relationships over the years, and more than a couple of cheaters. 4 to be exact (that I know of, I guess!). 2 of them would totally be described as shy, introverted types. I don't think any of the instances were *justified*, but I do understand the motives behind all of them, and what led to them.

I don't claim to be any type of expert, or anything, and I am sure my experience isn't 'average'. I am 32 years old, and have had a lot of relationships, mostly longer term committed relationships, with a few exceptions. I have dated lots of shy girls, outspoken girls, sweet friendly girls, crazy blacks-out-and-blows-some-dude-at-a party girls, loud girls, quiet girls, tall, short, large and small...

You really just have to make sure your relationships are healthy. I think figuring out that honesty *and* privacy are both important with one another, is a part of realizing a healthy adult relationship. Boundaries and privacy are good, but not at the expense of the relationship. Trust is something that you build with someone, and all feelings should be on the table. It also has to be equal. All of this is so much more important to whether cheating goes on than what the type of girl or guy is in any way.

tl;dr: **Most girls don't cheat on you, regardless of personality type, and most cheating is avoidable by ensuring an open, honest, and healthy relationship.**",,null,null,,0.091,0.76,0.149,0.9808,8,1,4,10,36,41,35,86,120

Personally, I think that it is important for people to have fun, and experience at least a few people in a few different ways. It is important to 'explore', essentially. She hadn't done that, and after our relationship had grown tired, she started exploring outside of it.

The second time, is a longer story. I don't know how much detail you want. We were together for a couple of years when my little brother died, suddenly and unexpectedly. We were very close in age (my brother and I) so it was incredibly hard on me. I withdrew in grief, and she felt too guilty to leave me in such a state. I couldn't be there for her, physically, emotionally, or anything, and she had to be the entire support structure for the relationship. Of course that couldn't last, and before a year or so she had a 'friend' come on to her while hanging out. You know the rest. I didn't actually even really blame her for a good while. We stayed together... got married, actually. The relationship ended about a year and a half ago, and we just signed divorce papers a few weeks ago (like I said, long story). Now, I understand that while the circumstances did drive her to do it (which was no one's 'fault') the fact is, she had to simply be the type of person who does not put *that much* value in the importance or meaning of monogamy, at the time. 

I do not necessarily think that a person can not change into one or the other. A cheater can realize it's wrong and start to value it more. A person who values it highly can also start valuing other things with higher priority. Like I said, I think it has 1 bazillion times more to do with how you approach the boundaries of your relationship.

1a079s,2,c8sxkvj,1a079s,1.362892646E9,caimcd,1,36,"Florida I believe is the flagship state that introduced drug-testing for welfare. The way Florida's system is arranged, when a welfare recipient pays for the test and it comes back negative, they are reimbursed. In the first 4,000 people tested roughly 100 came back positive for drugs. So Florida posted a net loss financially of paying back the 3,000 non-positive recipients, since kicking 100 people off welfare isn't going to equal that. 

I also think your logic that most tax-paying people hold jobs that require drug testing makes it ok to drug test welfare recipients is weak. The Florida numbers show that a lower percentage of welfare recipients are on drugs than the normal population (2.6% vs. 8.13%). I think the pop culture image of a welfare recipient being a doped up single mother/ gang member is influencing the public to believe that is actually the truth. And as well and good as it is to say <&quot;>remove children from the home<&quot;> we already have a foster care system swamped with children from truly bad situations, and I think it's ludicrous to add another child to that system because their parent/s might smoke some marijuana. Of course harder drugs is another issue, but do these tests differentiate between the types of drugs? 

Overall I'm against the idea because it wastes money and contributes to an already unhelpful view of welfare recipients as lazy, drugged, etc.

We don't require drug testing for people in order to receive drivers licenses. Requiring a drug test to receive welfare benefits is more analogous to requiring a drug test to receive a license than requiring a drug test if you get pulled over.

And BAC tests require probable cause (e.g. moving violations). You don't have to submit to a BAC test just because you have a license. Even if you get pulled over, a BAC test still requires probable cause. For example, if an officer pulls you over because you have a broken tail light, a BAC test would still be an unreasonable search because alcohol consumption can't be inferred from having a broken tail light.

Children of drug users maybe shouldn't be in a home with drug using parents - but refusing the parents welfare is not going to stop that. The parents will just not apply for welfare in the first place, and/or they will be using the kind of drugs that can clear out of the system in a few days and get the welfare, and then the child is still in a drug using household. The social services don't actually have resources for a whole lot of kids to move into foster care just because mommy smoked a joint while unemployed. They're busy dealing with kids who are being raped or beaten or neglected.

Lastly, it's a giant waste of money.

Drug testing is bullshit; even when it comes to hiring people.  A weekend pot smoker should not get fired for what they do off company hours.  If you go out partying and get drunk on the weekend you wouldn't get fired, so if you stay at home and smoke a couple bowls why should you end up jobless?  

Also you are wrong: not every job tests for drugs; mostly retail and food services.  Tons corporate jobs never test for drugs.  I don't have any numbers to back up my claims, but I'd be seriously surprised if even half of the jobs in USA drug test.  I worked corporate jobs for 15+ years and never once got drug tested, and I changed jobs quite frequently.

And what you're saying is that people on welfare should get kicked off it for smoking pot, but if they drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes than that's perfectly fine.  That's not really logical, considering pot is not as dangerous as the other two.  It's one thing if you're talking about healthcare that taxes have to pay for, but people smoking pot aren't going to rack up medical bills like people smoking cigs or drinking alcohol are.

Let's then say for example that pot is specifically excluded from the drug tests.  I think the number of people who use other illegal drugs is such a low % of the overall population of people on welfare that it would actually cost a lot more money to perform the drug tests than what would be saved by kicking them off.  

Contrary to popular belief, welfare is not that easy to get approved for, and the drug addicts you're worried about are not that likely to even bother applying for it ... generally they'd rather steal, sell drugs, engage in other illegal activities, or panhandle than jump through the necessary hoops to collect a government check.

Most people on welfare are not lazy moochers, but average people who have fallen on hard times.  It is also a false to assume that everyone on welfare has never paid taxes; many have had jobs at some point in time and in fact have contributed into the system.

Test scores are horrible ways of predicting a student's success in college. Highschool class grades are only a little better: we can be reasonably certain that someone who took AP math classes is ready for college level math, perhaps, but not much more. Nobody is competitive on grades or test scores; they're used to determine whose essays and recommendations we read.

For undergraduate admissions, there is a lot of pressure for increasing student retention. As a result, committees look at whatever qualities they think will maximize the chances of a student staying in school. When I was serving on that committee, we were asked to evaluate the student's leadership and initiative from their essays and recommendations. My scoring was one point for every club, one point for every leadership position, one point for marginalized or non-popular or non-traditional clubs, and a couple of points for how many waves they made.

People are good at surviving. It's basically what we're built to do, along with reproduction. And that doesn't just mean in a <&quot;>live in the woods and kill your own food<&quot;> sense; humans are resourceful, creative, and driven to preserve their own existence.

The purpose of the welfare system is not to keep people alive, it's to elevate people from the basest levels of poverty and ensure that (most) everyone in our society lives with some basic quality of life. 

If you remove the welfare system, what happens?

When the welfare is removed, these poor have three options, in order of desirability:

1. Find a job and work (often not possible because jobs are not always available, and very few managers want to hire homeless or near-homeless employees with few skills). They then have a stream of income and, according to you, do great.

2. Become homeless and scavenge, busk, or rely on charitable organizations to survive. There will never be a shortage of people willing to help those less fortunate, and there will never not be *something* that someone's discarded to scavenge from, so these people will eek out the barest of livings living on the streets, which will create problems for most urban centers.

3. Resort to crime. Remember, each of us wants to survive. When life gets tough enough, and you start to get desperate enough, it gets really tempting to just take what you need. If you get away with it, you stay alive until you have to steal/mug/prostitute yourself/etc. again. If you don't, you get caught and go live in a prison cell, with free food, shelter, and medicine provided by the government until your time's up and they toss you back out on the streets where, presumably, you begin to steal again. In both cases, crime rates rise.

In no scenario do the poor (in keeping with your premise, the <&quot;>poor<&quot;> I'm referring to don't work and live entirely off welfare) all die off in droves, because they want to survive and will find a way to do so. Sure some of them will die--of curable diseases, exposure, malnutrition, etc.--but most will not. 

So what your proposal results in is this: Most poor people become homeless or live on the verges of homelessness, eking out a living however they can. In cities, poor who were formerly living in some sort of low-income housing now wander the streets, which distresses most inhabitants. Crime rates rise as people turn to the only source of income they can think of to support themselves. This also distresses most residents. A few poor people get off their lazy asses and get a job.

In all, the quality of our society decreases and few people end up happier. The <&quot;>cycle of poverty<&quot;> does not end. It endures more visibly than before.

This isn't even taking into account the assumptions you make about the poor, including, but not limited to:

* (Most/All) People on welfare never try to work for themselves

* It is possible to find a job and earn a living through hard work alone, external factors beyond an individual's control have no effect.

* Only poor people have kids who become poor.

* People can live on welfare for their whole lives.",,null,null,,0.163,0.748,0.089,-0.9944,4,1,22,14,148,111,46,82,186

&gt;So what it comes down to is that welfare keeps people from resorting to crime

Well there are humanitarian aspects to it as well, but from a practical viewpoint Welfare is a way to reduce income disparity within a nation.
The most commonly used index for measuring disparity of income is GINI. Below is a link to a graph that plots GINI against Homicide rate (murder per 100 000 inhabitants.

[GINI vs Homicides - Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/HkC3NAP.png)

**Explanation of graph:** A higher GINI indicates higher disparity i.e higher inequality. As can be seen from the graph, there seems to be a clear correlation between inequality and murder rates. One would assume the same holds true for violent crimes in general, but no good data on this.
